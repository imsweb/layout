<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Code for the patient's usual occupation, using U.S. Census Bureau codes (see note below) according to coding procedures recommended for death certificates.22 This data item applies only to patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Usual occupation is defined as type of job the patient was engaged in for most of his or her working life.<br/>
<br/>
Note: Occupation/industry coding should NOT be performed by reporting facilities. This is a central registry data item. Specially trained and qualified personnel should perform coding.<br/>
<br/>
Note: 2010 Census codes for occupation are recommended for tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2010.23,40 However, the 2010 Census codes are 4 digits and the field currently allows only 3 digits. The field will be expanded to a 4 digit code in NAACCR Standards Volume II, Version 13. Until this revision, any 4-digit Census codes should be transmitted in a state requestor field and this field [Item 270] should be left blank. 3-digit 2000 Census codes for occupation are recommended for tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2003, and prior to January 1, 2010.23,25 3-digit 1990 Census codes for occupation are recommended for tumors diagnosed before January 1, 2003.24,26 For more information, see the U.S. Bureau of the Census website at: <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/ioindex.html" target="_blank">http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/ioindex.html</a>.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Use of the Census Bureau classification system improves consistency of data collected from multiple sources. The Census Bureau occupation classification system is used for coding occupation information from death certificates and from the U.S. Census of Population. The system includes specific coding rules. 21-26,40

        <td class="naaccr-codes-cell naaccr-codes-padding naaccr-codes-nowrap">Software for automated coding of industry and occupation to 1990 Census classifications is available from the Division of Safety Research, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, CDC (<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/SOIC/" target="_blank">http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/SOIC/</a>). As of press time, NIOSH is developing new web-based software for automated coding of industry and occupation to appropriate year Census (1990, 2000, or 2010) classifications. The contact person for this software (which will be available after October 2012) is Sue Nowlin, who can be contacted at sxn1@cdc.gov or (513) 841-4467. <br/>
<br/>
Registries may want to wait to code industry and occupation until NAACCR Standards Volume II, Version 13 is released and the NIOSH autocoding software is available.</td>
