<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This data item is used to identify the month, day and year the patient is diagnosed with multiple tumors reported as a single primary using the SEER, IARC, or Canadian Cancer Registry multiple primary rules. See page 99 for date format. Use DATE OF MULT TUMORS FLAG [439] if there is no appropriate or known date for this item.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Patients with multiple tumors may have a worse prognosis or more extensive treatment than patients with a single tumor. This data item will make it possible to identify important information about these cases for data analysis. The Date of Multiple Tumors will allow separation of cases with multiple tumors present at the time of initial diagnosis from cases with subsequent tumors abstracted as the same primary. The date will allow tracking of the time interval between the date of original diagnosis and the first date of subsequent tumor(s) for specific primary sites and tumor histologies.
