<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This data item belongs to the Collaborative Stage (CS) Data Collection System which is based on the <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</i>, 6th and 7th editions. The post-treatment data items measure the amount of tumor remaining after neoadjuvant therapy (systemic therapy or radiation therapy prior to surgery). The implementation of this data item has been deferred indefinitely.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The post-treatment data items will be used for analysis of the effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapy.

<br/><br/><b>Codes (See the most current version of the <i>Collaborative Stage Data Collection System</i> (<a href="http://cancerstaging.org" target="_blank">http://cancerstaging.org</a>), for rules and site-specific codes and coding structures.)</b><br/>
