<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This data item belongs to the Collaborative Stage (CS) Data Collection System which is based on the <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</i>, 6th and 7th editions. AJCC T, N, M plus descriptors and AJCC staging components are composed of combinations of characters, numbers, and/or special characters and can be of varying lengths. To more easily handle these components a numeric code was assigned to each unique category for each T, N, M plus the post-treatment AJCC 7th edition "T" and is derived from CS coded fields using the CS algorithm. This numeric representation is referred to as the "storage" code and its associated label is referred to as the "display" code. Explanations of the "storage" codes and their corresponding "display" codes can be found in the most current version of the <i>Collaborative Stage Data Collection System</i> (<a href="http://cancerstaging.org/cstage/manuals.html" target="_blank">http://cancerstaging.org/cstage/manuals.html</a>). The display code should be used for display on the screen and in reports.<br/>
<br/>
The implementation of this data item has been deferred indefinitely.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The Collaborative Stage Data Collection System was designed by a joint task force including representatives from SEER, ACoS, CDC, NAACCR, NCRA, CCCR, CPAC, and AJCC, to provide a single uniform set of codes and rules for coding extent of disease (EOD) and stage information to meet the needs of all of the participating standard setters. When CS data items are coded, a computer algorithm provides the derivation of T, N, M, and stage-based on AJCC Cancer Staging Manual 6th &amp; 7th Editions, SEER Summary Stage 1977, and SEER Summary Stage 2000. There are separate derived CS fields in the NAACCR record based on AJCC 6th Edition for 2004+ cases and AJCC 7th Edition for 2010+ cases.
