<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Name of city of the patient's current usual residence. If the patient has multiple tumors, the current city of residence should be the same for all tumors.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
"Current address" can be used to measure the regional "cancer burden" (cost, medical care needs), especially in major retirement regions. Sometimes central registries carry out follow-up by contacting the patients by a letter or telephone calls to ascertain their vital status. The most current reported address and telephone number are needed. This information is also useful for conducting interview studies.
