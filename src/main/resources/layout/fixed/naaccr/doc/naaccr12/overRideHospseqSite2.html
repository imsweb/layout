<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct. <br/>
<br/>
This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seq Num--Hosp, Primary Site, Morph ICDO2 (CoC)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seq Num--Hosp, Primary Site, Morph ICDO3 (CoC)

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See Chapter IV, Recommended Data Edits and Software Coordination of Standards.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</b><br/>
Edits of the type Seq Num--Hosp, Primary Site, Morph differ in use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 morphology. They force review of multiple primary cancers when one of the primaries is coded to a site/morphology combination that could indicate a metastatic site rather than a primary site. <br/>
<ol><li>If Sequence Number--Hospital indicates the person has had more than one primary, then any case with one of the following site/histology combinations requires review:<br/></li></ol>
<ul><li>C760-C768 (ill-defined sites) or C809 (unknown primary) and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology &lt; 9590. Look for evidence that the unknown or ill-defined primary is a secondary site from one of the patient's other cancers. For example, a clinical discharge diagnosis of "abdominal carcinomatosis" may be attributable to the patient's primary ovarian cystadenocarcinoma already in the registry, and should not be entered as a second primary.</li>
<li>C770-C779 (lymph nodes) and ICD-O-2 histology not in range 9590-9717 or ICD-O-3 histology not in the range 9590-9729; or C420-C424 and ICD-O-2 histology not in range 9590-9941 or ICD-O-3 histology not in the range 9590-9989. That combination is most likely a metastatic lesion. Check whether the lesion could be a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers.</li>
<li>Any site and ICD-O-2 histology in the range 9720-9723, 9740-9741 or ICD-O-3 histology in the range 9740-9758. Verify that these diagnoses are coded correctly and are indeed separate primaries from the others.</li></ul><br/>
<ol><li>If it turns out that the suspect tumor is a manifestation of one of the patient's other cancers, delete the metastatic or secondary case, re-sequence remaining cases, and correct the coding on the original case as necessary.<br/></li></ol>
<br/>
<b>Instructions for Coding</b><br/>
<ul><li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for an edit of the type Seq Num--Hosp, Primary Site, Morph.</li>
<li>Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms that hospital sequence number and site are both correct.</li></ul>
