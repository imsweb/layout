<div class='content chap10-para'>
    <p>This item indicates the version of the AJCC Cancer Surveillance .dll incorporated into the cancer registry software that created the record with stage data diagnosed 2018 and later. It should be recorded the first time the AJCC ID (including a value of XX) and/or Schema ID are determined using the .dll. The value is obtained from the .dll.</p>

    <div>The AJCC Cancer Surveillance API contains contents to support collection of AJCC&#8217;s TNM, EOD, and directly entered Summary Stage 2018. The underlying contents are loaded from AJCC&#8217;s API and SEER&#8217;s web service. The API is versioned independently from the imported contents.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    The value indicates the version of the AJCC Cancer Surveillance API originally used to code the items listed below and is obtained from the API. It should be recorded the first time the AJCC ID (including a value of XX) and/or Schema ID is determined and should not be updated each time the related input fields are modified.&nbsp; However, if changes made to the diagnosis and/or date of diagnosis result in a different AJCC ID and/or Schema ID, the value for Cancer Surveillance API Version Original should be reset.<br/>&nbsp;
