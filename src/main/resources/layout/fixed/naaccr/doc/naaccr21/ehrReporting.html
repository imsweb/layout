<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.ehrReporting<br/><br/>


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Cancer case reports transmitted from electronic health records (EHR) in the HL7 CDA (Clinical Document Architecture) format must adhere to specifications and requirements as defined by the Implementation Guide (IG) which has been adopted by the Office of the National Coordinator of for Health Information Technology. The IG specifies collection and transmission of cancer diagnosis fields including (but not limited to) primary site, histology, behavior, diagnosis date, and staging elements. The IG also specifies transmission of other data documented in the EHR as part of the care of the patient which are also standardized, but are not routinely collected by cancer registries in the same way or as discrete items. Examples of these are procedures, medications, smoking, and vital signs (i.e., height, weight, BMI). Currently, software tools such as CDC&#8217;s eMaRC Plus parse some EHR elements and map or translate these fields to NAACCR items. However, some data are not able to be mapped to discrete items. This new proposed field will allow central cancer registries to collect information from the EHR and map these data in the NAACCR record layout so that they can be included in the central registry database and be available to enhance surveillance data.
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Central cancer registries may wish to integrate EHR data, which are not already in the NAACCR record layout, into their databases. The EHR Reporting Field will allow central cancer registries to capture data that are received from EHR systems as discrete items. Collection of these data in this field will allow central cancer registries to assess ways in which the EHR data can be standardized in the NAACCR record layout in the future.</div>
