<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This item stores the results of NPCR's derived algorithmic calculation of pathologic stage group based on AJCC T, N, and M and relevant biomarkers and prognostic factors. The algorithm derives AJCC 8th ed. stage group for 2018, however, updates to future AJCC editions are anticipated. The derived values for 7th ed. were stored in NPCR Derived Path Stg Grp [3655].</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>The purpose of the derived stage fields is to segregate data values for AJCC stage groups derived from the NPCR algorithm from values directly entered from the medical record or by the registrar. NPCR's primary interest is in the directly-entered values, but derived values will have a purpose primarily at the central registry. It is important to not mix data values from the two sources in the same data items. This item was added in 2018 because the required length to hold AJCC stage group values increased from 4 columns to 15.</div>
