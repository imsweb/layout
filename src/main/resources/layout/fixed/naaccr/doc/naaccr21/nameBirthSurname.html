<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Patient.nameBirthSurname<br/><br/>


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Last name (surname) of patient at birth, regardless of gender or marital status.&nbsp;


    <br/>Other alternate names should be recorded in the data item, Name--Alias [2280].
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This can be used to link reports on a person whose surname might be different on different documents. It is also useful when using a Spanish surname algorithm to categorize ethnicity.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Codes</div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>The field should be left blank if the birth surname is not known or not applicable. Since a value in this field may be used by linkage software or other computer algorithms, only legitimate surnames are allowable, and any variation of &#8220;unknown&#8221; or &#8220;not applicable&#8221; is not allowable.<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> This data item was introduced to be a gender-neutral birth-surname data item, analogous to Name--Maiden [2390]. It is to have been populated in the 2021 conversion by values in [2390]. The original (Name--Maiden) data item had been supported by CoC until January 1, 2003.
