<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This variable was created for use in cause-specific survival and designates that the person died of their cancer.<br/><br/>Adapted from
    <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/causespecific/">http://seer.cancer.gov/causespecific/</a>:<br/>Cause-specific survival is a net survival measure representing survival of a specified cause of death in the absence of other causes of death. Estimates are calculated by specifying the cause of death. Individuals who die of causes other than the specified cause are considered to be censored. This requires a cause of death variable that accurately captures all causes related to the specific cause. Vital records offices use algorithms to process causes of death from death certificates in order to identify a single, disease-specific, underlying cause of death. In some cases, attribution of a single cause of death may be difficult and misattribution may occur. For example a death may be attributed to the site of metastasis instead of the primary site.<br/><br/>To capture deaths related to the specific cancer but not coded as such, the SEER cause-specific death classification variables are defined by taking into account causes of deaths in conjunction with tumor sequence (i.e., only one tumor or the first of subsequent tumors), site of the original cancer diagnosis, and comorbidities (e.g., AIDS and/or site-related diseases).<br/><br/>The 'SEER cause-specific death classification' variable is used to obtain cancer-specific survival probability for a given cohort of cancer patients. Deaths attributed to the cancer of interest are treated as events and deaths from other causes are treated as censored observation. This variable is used in SEER*Stat cause-specific survival and crude probability of death using cause of death information.

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>These changes will benefit the cancer surveillance community by facilitating the application of standard methods for survival analysis. Beginning with data collected in the November 2014 call for data, NAACCR has published


    <em>Cancer in North America Volume 4: Cancer Survival in the United States and Canada</em>, which provides cancer survival estimates on a wider population than was previously available. However, at present IMS must pre-process the datasets that are included in the NAACCR survival dataset to calculate the four new standard data items, SEER Cause Specific COD [1914], SEER Other COD [1915], Record Number Recode [1775], and Vital Status Recode [1762]. For registries that do not submit cause of death information to NAACCR, it is not possible to calculate the 'SEER cause-specific death classification' or 'SEER other cause of death classification' variables. The 4 new data items will assist individual registries in performing survival analyses using their own data.
