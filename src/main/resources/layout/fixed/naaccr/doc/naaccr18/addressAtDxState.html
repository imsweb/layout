<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;State (pre-96 CoC)


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Identifies the patient&#8217;s state or province of residence at the time of diagnosis as identified by the Reporting Source. For consolidated records, the state may be based on reported or corrected residential address information.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>
    <div> The state of residence is part of the patient's demographic data and has multiple uses. It can be used to evaluate referral patterns, allows for the analysis of cancer cluster concerns, and supports epidemiological studies that use area-based social measures.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><strong>Instructions for Coding </strong></div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>This field is intended to store residential state for the patient's physical, residential address. The state for PO Box mailing address should not be entered into this data item except in the infrequent case when no other address information is available.</li>
            <li>If the patient has multiple tumors, state at diagnosis may be different for each tumor.</li>
            <li>Do not update this item if the patient's residential address changes. Store address update information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnosis. For instance, it is appropriate to correct a state during the geocoding or consolidation process.</li>
            <li>Use the U.S. Postal Service abbreviation (for the state, territory, commonwealth, U.S. possession) or Canada Post abbreviation (for the Canadian province/territory) in which the patient resides at the time the reportable tumor is diagnosed.</li>
            <li>If the patient is a foreign resident, then code either XX or YY depending on the circumstance.<br/></li>
