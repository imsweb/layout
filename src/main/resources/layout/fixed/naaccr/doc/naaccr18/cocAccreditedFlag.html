<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>CoC Accredited Flag is assigned at the point and time of data abstraction to label an abstract being prepared for an analytic cancer case at a facility accredited by the Commission on Cancer (CoC). The flag may be assigned manually or can be defaulted by the registry&#8217;s software.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>CoC-accredited facilities are required to collect certain data items including TNM staging. It is burdensome for central registries to maintain a list of accredited facilities, and the list changes frequently. The flag is a means of incorporating the accredited status into abstracts at the time of abstraction by someone who has knowledge of the status. The flag thus simplifies validating that required items have been abstracted by CoC-accredited facilities. NPCR will use this flag to for validating and consolidating TNM.</div>
