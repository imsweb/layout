<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.radiationTxDiscontinuedEarly<br/><br/>


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This field is used to identify patients/tumors whose radiation treatment course was discontinued earlier than initially planned. That is the patients/tumors received fewer treatment fractions (sessions) than originally intended by the treating physician. This data item is required for CoC-accredited facilities as of cases diagnosed 01/01/2018 and later.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Currently, the total dose of radiation reflects what was actually delivered rather than what was intended. When a patient doesn&#8217;t complete a radiation course as initially intended this is typically commented on within the radiation end of treatment summary. By flagging these patients within the cancer registry database, these patients can be excluded from analyses attempting to describe adherence to radiation treatment guidelines or patterns of care analyses.</div>
