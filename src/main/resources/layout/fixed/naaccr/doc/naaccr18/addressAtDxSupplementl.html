<strong>Alternate Names</strong>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Patient Address (Number and Street) at Diagnosis--Supplemental (CoC)


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Provides the ability to store additional address information such as the name of a place or facility (for example a nursing home, apartment complex, jail or PO Box residential or other mailing address) at the time of diagnosis.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Sometimes the registry receives the name of a facility instead of a proper street address containing the street number, name, direction, and other elements necessary to locate an address on a street file for the purpose of geocoding. By having a second street address field to hold address information, the registry can look up and store the street address and not lose the facility name due to a shortage of space.
    <br/><br/>The presence of a second street address field to hold additional address information also aids in follow-up. For instance, Addr At DX--No &amp; Street [2330] should contain a street address only. However, it is important to retain any known PO Box information when linking for cohort studies or patient contact studies. Retaining facility name can also help correct errors in Addr At DX--No &amp; Street [2330] or assist with geocoding or consolidation. Additionally, researchers can use this field to verify if geographic areas of high risk are driven by location of facilities, such as jails, nursing homes, or homeless shelters.<br/>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div><strong>Instructions for Coding </strong></div>
    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>Record the name of the place or facility (for example nursing home, apartment complex, prison/jail or group home) of the patient&#8217;s residence when the tumor was diagnosed. Do not use this item for information stored in other address items such as Addr At DX--NO &amp; Street [2330].</li>
            <li>Record a full residential PO Box here (including city &amp; zip code) or other non-physical, residential mailing address here.</li>
            <li>Record HOMELESS here when the street address used is a shelter or diagnosing facility for persons with no usual residence.</li>
            <li>If the patient has multiple tumors, address at diagnosis supplemental may be different for each tumor.</li>
            <li>Do not update this item if the patient&#8217;s residential address changes. Store updated address information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnosis. For instance, it is appropriate to correct supplemental address during the geocoding or consolidation process.</li>
            <li>Refer to <em>STORE </em>for residency rules. <br/></li>
