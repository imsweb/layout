<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This is a 12 character concatenation of state, county, tract and block group. This data item may be used for epidemiological purposes. For example, to measure cancer incidence in a particular geographic area. Components of this code are used to derive area-based social measures such as poverty or urban/rural codes at the county or tract-level. The codes are primarily derived through the geocoding process.<br/><br/><strong>Subfields</strong><br/>State at DX Geocode 2020 [84]<br/>County at DX Geocode2020 [97]<br/>Census Tract 2020 [125]<br/>Census Block Group 2020 [361]

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>The concatenation of these variables into the full 12 character code is primarily a bookkeeping improvement over collecting the components separately. This format aligns with how the U.S census describes geographic entities in its many files and will enable direct linkage with census data over time. This format is also compatible with how the NAACCR geocoder returns information and will remove problems related to the leading zeros in census tracts. And because geocoded county codes are embedded in this field, it is less likely they will be confused with the NAACCR Item [90], County at DX Reported, which is often not associated with the geocoded census tract resulting in an edit failure for county-tract accuracy.<br/><br/><strong>Instructions for coding</strong><br/>A 12 character string, with a maximum of one leading zero, left aligned. The code is generated by geocoding. Only numbers or blanks allowed. No decimal points or other characters allowed.
    <br/><br/>The codes, with the exception of four 2-character alpha character codes for the State, are the Census Bureau ANSI/FIPS codes. Lists of geographic FIPS codes in census products can be found on the
    <a href="https://www.census.gov/geo/reference/ansi.html" target="_blank">ANSI/FIPS Codes</a> page.<br/><br/>ANSI/FIPS codes follow census boundaries and are only unique when the smallest census boundary code is associated with the larger boundaries. For example, county at diagnosis is essential for investigating epidemiologic pattern at both the county and the census tract level. Census tracts are nested within counties and designated with a 6-digit number code. A given census tract code is commonly repeated within a state in different counties, making census tract numbers unique only when paired with the state and the county. Example from Massachusetts: Rural Franklin County contains a tract 040600 with 2010 population 4,612 people, and urban Suffolk County contains a tract 040600 with 2,444 people.
