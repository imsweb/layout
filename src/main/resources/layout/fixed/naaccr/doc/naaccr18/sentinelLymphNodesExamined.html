<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Records the total number of lymph nodes sampled during the sentinel node biopsy and examined by the pathologist. This data item is required for CoC-accredited facilities as of cases diagnosed 01/01/2018 and later.


    <strong>This data item is required for breast and melanoma cases only. </strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>It is a known fact that sentinel lymph node biopsies have been under-reported. Additionally, the timing and results of sentinel lymph node biopsy procedures are used in quality of care measures. This data item can be used to more accurately assess the number of lymph nodes biopsied during the sentinel node biopsy procedure separate from the number of lymph nodes dissected during additional subsequent regional node procedures.</div>
