<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Use of the Census Bureau classification system improves consistency of data collected from multiple sources. The Census Bureau occupation classification system is used for coding occupation information from death certificates and from the U.S. Census of Population. The system includes specific coding rules.
