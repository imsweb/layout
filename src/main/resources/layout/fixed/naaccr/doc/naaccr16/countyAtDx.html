<div class='content chap10-para'>Code for the county of the patient&#8217;s residence at the time the tumor was diagnosed. For U.S. residents, standard codes are those of the FIPS publication &#8220;Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas.&#8221; If the patient has multiple tumors, the county codes may be different for each tumor.<br/><br/>Detailed standards have not been set for Canadian provinces/territories.

    <em>Note: </em>See Appendix A for standard FIPS county codes. See EDITS Table BPLACE.DBF in Appendix B for geocodes used by CoC.<em><br/><br/>Note:</em> SEER does not use code 998.
