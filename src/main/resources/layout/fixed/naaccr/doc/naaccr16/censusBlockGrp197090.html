<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
    <div>This field is provided for coding the block group of patient&#8217;s residence at time of diagnosis, as defined by the 1970, 1980, or 1990 Census.</div>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Formerly CensusBlockGroup 70/80/90.</div>
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>A block group is a subdivision of a census tract or block numbering area (BNA). Not all of the United States was described by a census block group or BNA prior to the 2000 Census, but for areas assigned to block groups or BNAs, the Census Bureau published detailed population and socioeconomic data. Block groups thus offer a high level of specificity for geographical and socioeconomic analyses, where available.<br/><br/>A block group has no meaning in the absence of a census tract. Refer to Census Tr Cert 1970/80/90 [364] to ascertain the basis of assignment of Census Block Grp 1970-90 [368]. Refer to Census Cod Sys 1970/80/90 [120] to ascertain the decade of reference.
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
    <strong>Comment</strong>Numerous registries find the distinction between &#8220;attempted, could not be determined&#8221; (zero) and &#8220;not coded&#8221; (blank) to be useful for geocoding planning purposes.
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
    <em>Note:</em> The values 1 through 9 are nominal, with no hierarchy of values. This number determines the first digit of all the blocks which comprise the block group; for instance, census block group 3 would contain blocks numbered 3000 to 3999
