            <div>Cancer registries collect cancer information from various sources including pathology laboratories. Pathology reports of different types may be sent via HL7 messages. Included here are data items coming from such a message to be included in the cancer registry database to aid in consolidating a cancer case when there is information from multiple sources. Traditionally, these data items were not part of the NAACCR Standards Volume II record layout and therefore provide a link to NAACCR Standards Volume V.
