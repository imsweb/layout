<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This data item provides the ability to store additional address information such as the name of a place or facility, a nursing home, or the name of an apartment complex. This can be used to generate a follow-up inquiry, and must correspond to other fields in the current address. If the patient has multiple tumors, the current address should be the same.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Sometimes the registry receives the name of a facility instead of a proper street address containing the street number, name, direction, and other elements necessary to locate an address on a street file for the purpose of geocoding. By having a second street address field to hold address information, the registry can look up and store the street address and not lose the facility name due to a shortage of space. The presence of a second street address field to hold additional address information also aids in follow-up.</div>
