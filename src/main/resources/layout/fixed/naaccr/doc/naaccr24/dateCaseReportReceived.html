This item can be used with the Date of 1st Contact [580] or the Path--Date of Specimen Collection [7320] to measure timeliness of reporting to central cancer registries by individual reporting facilities. This data item also can be used with the Date Tumor Record Availbl [2113] to measure timeliness of processing within the central cancer registry.</p>
