<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.censusBlockGroup2000<br/><br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>This field is provided for coding the block group of patient’s residence at time of diagnosis, as defined by the 2000 Census.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>A block group is a subdivision of a census tract designed to have an average of 1500 people, versus a census tract’s average of 4500 people. All land area in the United States is described by a census block group in the 2000 Census. The Census Bureau publishes detailed population and socioeconomic data at this level.</p>
<p>Block groups thus offer a high level of specificity for geographical and socioeconomic analyses. A block group has no meaning in the absence of a census tract. Refer to Census Tr Certainty 2000 [365] to ascertain basis of assignment of Census Block Group 2000.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p><strong>Comment</strong></p>
<p>Numerous registries find the distinction between “attempted, could not be determined” (zero) and “not coded” (blank) to be useful for geocoding planning purposes.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p><em>Note:</em> The values 1 through 9 are nominal, with no hierarchy of values. This number determines the first digit of all the blocks which comprise the block group; for instance, census block group 3 would contain blocks numbered 3000 to 3999.</p>
