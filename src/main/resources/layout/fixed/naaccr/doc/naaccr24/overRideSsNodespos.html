<strong>Alternate Names</strong>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct.</p>
<p>This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Summary Stage 1977, Regional Nodes Pos (NAACCR)</li>
<li>Summary Stage 2000, Regional Nodes Pos (NAACCR)</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error or warning message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See <a href="https://www.naaccr.org/standard-data-edits/"><strong>Standards for Cancer Registries, Standard Data Edits</strong></a>. </p>
<p><strong>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</strong></p>
<p>The edit Summary Stage 1977, Regional Nodes Pos (NAACCR) checks SEER Summary Stage 1977 against Regional Nodes Positive and generates an error or warning if there is an incompatibility between the two data items. The edit Summary Stage 2000, Regional Nodes Pos (NAACCR) checks SEER Summary Stage 2000 against Regional Nodes Positive and generates an error or warning if there is an incompatibility between the two data items. </p>
<p><strong>Instructions for Coding</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for the edit Summary Stage 1977, Regional Nodes Pos (NAACCR) or the edit Summary Stage 2000, Regional Nodes Pos (NAACCR).</li>
<li>Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Code 1 if the case has been reviewed and it has been verified that the case has both SEER Summary Stage 1977 and Nodes Positive coded correctly or SEER Summary Stage 2000 and Nodes Positive coded correctly.</li>
</ul>
