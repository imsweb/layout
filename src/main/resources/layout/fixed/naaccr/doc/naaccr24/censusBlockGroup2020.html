<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>This field is provided for coding the block group of patient's residence at time of diagnosis, as defined by the 2020 Census.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>A block group is a subdivision of a census tract designed to have approximately 1500, socially homogeneous people, versus census tracts which are designed to have approximately 4000 people. All land area in the United States is described by a census block group in the 2020 Census. The Census Bureau publishes detailed population and socioeconomic data at this level. Block groups thus offer a high level of specificity for geographical and socioeconomic analyses.</p>
<p>A block group has no meaning in the absence of a census tract. Refer to Census Tr Certainty 2020 [369] to ascertain basis of assignment of Census Block Group 2020.</p>

<p><strong>Comment</strong>:</p>
<p>Historically, some registries made the distinction between &quot;attempted, could not be determined&quot; and &quot;not coded&quot; by using a 0 for &quot;attempted.&quot; However, 0 is a valid block group value.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: The values 0 through 9 are nominal, with no hierarchy of values. This number determines the first digit of all the blocks which comprise the block group; for instance, census block group 3 would contain blocks numbered 3000 to 3999.</p>
