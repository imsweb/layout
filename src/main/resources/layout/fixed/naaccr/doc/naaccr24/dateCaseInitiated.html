<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Date the electronic abstract is initiated in the reporting facility's cancer registry database. See <a href="https://apps.naaccr.org/data-dictionary/data-dictionary/version=24/chapter-view/data-descriptor-table/"><strong>Data Descriptor Table</strong></a> for date format. Standard edits check that no dates are later than the current date or the date completed.</p>

<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>This item is used to assess and monitor the timeliness of reporting. Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) is a concern for all standard-setting organizations and consequently, timeliness standards have been established. Examples of use are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>This item can be used with the Date of 1^st^Contact [580] to measure timeliness of abstracting by individual reporting facilities.</li>
<li>This item can be used with Date Case Report Exported [2110] to determine the &quot;residency time&quot; of a case report within a reporting facility's database prior to data transmission to a central cancer registry.</li>
<li>This item can be used with Date Case Report Received [2111] to monitor central registry timeliness in entering case reports (for case reports abstracted in-house from hardcopy provided by a reporting facility).</li>
<li>This item can be used with Date Case Completed [2090] to monitor timeliness of case report completion.</li>
</ul>
