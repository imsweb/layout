<p>Information on census tract and census tract certainty is required. Census Tract and Census Tract Certainty should be recorded in the year-appropriate data item fields in order to reflect demographic information at the time of diagnosis. Until the 2020 Census is completed and data are available for geocoding, tumors diagnosed in 2020 or later, should be coded to the 2010 census definitions and recorded in Census Tract 2010 [135] and Census Tr Certainty 2000 [367]. When the 2020 Census data are available for geocoding, tumors diagnosed in 2020 or later must be coded to the 2020 census tract definitions and recorded in Census Tract 2020 [371] and Census Tract Certainty 2020 [369]. For tumors diagnosed between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2019, use of Census Tract 2020 [371] and Census Track Certainty 2020 [369] is recommended.</p>
