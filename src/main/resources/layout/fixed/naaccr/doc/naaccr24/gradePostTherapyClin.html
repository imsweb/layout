<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.gradePostTherapyClin<br/><br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>This data item records the grade of a solid primary tumor that has been microscopically sampled following neoadjuvant therapy or primary systemic/radiation therapy. If AJCC staging is being assigned, the tumor must have met the neoadjuvant therapy or primary systemic/radiation therapy requirements in the AJCC manual or according to national treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>Record the highest grade documented from the microscopically sampled specimen of the primary site following neoadjuvant therapy or primary systemic/radiation therapy.</p>
<p>For cases diagnosed January 1, 2020, and later, this data item, along with Grade Clinical, Grade Pathological, and Grade Post Therapy Path (yp), replaces NAACCR Data Item Grade [440] as well as SSF’s for cancer sites with alternative grading systems (e.g., breast [Bloom-Richardson], prostate [Gleason]).</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Grade is a measure of the aggressiveness of the tumor. Grade and cell type are important prognostic indicators for many cancers. For some sites, grade is required to assign the post therapy stage group.</p>
<p>For those cases that are eligible for AJCC staging, the recommended grading system is specified in the AJCC Chapter. The AJCC Chapter-specific grading systems (codes 1-5, L, H, M, S) take priority over the generic grade definitions (codes A-E, 9). For those cases that are not eligible for AJCC staging, if the recommended grading system is not documented, the generic grade definitions would apply.</p>
