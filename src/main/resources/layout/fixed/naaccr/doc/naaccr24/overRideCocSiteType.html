<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.overRideCocSiteType<br/><br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct.</p>
<p>This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary Site, Morphology-Type ICDO2 (CoC)</li>
<li>Primary Site, Morphology-Type ICDO3 (CoC)</li>
<li>Primary Site, Morphology-Type, Behavior ICDO3 (CoC)</li>
</ul>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See <a href="https://www.naaccr.org/standard-data-edits/"><strong>Standards for Cancer Registries, Standard Data Edits</strong></a>. </p>
<p><strong>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</strong></p>
<p>Multiple versions of edits of the type Primary Site, Morphology-Type check for &quot;usual&quot; combinations of site and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the CoC edit, and thus, uses a different over-ride flag. The CoC version of the edit will accept Over-ride CoC Site/Type or Over-ride Site/Type (the SEER edit) as equivalent.</p>
<p>The Site/Histology validation list (available on the SEER web site) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary site. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not included. These edits require review of all combinations not listed.</p>
<p>Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non-genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the CoC version of the edit, if primary site is in the range C440-C449 (skin), and ICD-O-2 histology is in the range 8000-8004 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8045 (epithielial carcinomas), 8050-8082 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), or ICD-O-3 histology is in the range 8000-8005 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8046 (epithelial carcinomas), 8050-8084 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), no further editing is done. No over-ride is necessary for these cases in the CoC version of the edit.</p>
<p>Review of these cases requires investigating whether the combination is biologically plausible or whether cancer registry coding conventions would allow different codes for the diagnosis. Review of these rare combinations often results in a change to either the site or histology. </p>
<p><strong>Instructions for Coding</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for the CoC edits of the type Primary Site, Morphology-Type.</li>
<li>Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Code 1 if review of all items in the error or warning message confirms they are correct and coded in conformance with coding rules.</li>
</ol>
