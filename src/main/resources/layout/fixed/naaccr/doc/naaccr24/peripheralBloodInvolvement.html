<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.peripheralBloodInvolvement<br/><br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Peripheral blood involvement, summarized in &quot;B category&quot;, refers to the percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes that are atypical (Sezary) cells and whether they are &quot;Clone negative&quot; or &quot;Clone positive&quot;.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Peripheral blood involvement is a prognostic factor required in AJCC 8th edition, Chapter 81 <em>Primary Cutaneous Lymphomas</em>, for staging of Mycosis Fungoides and Sezary Syndrome. It was previously collected as Mycosis Fungoides, CS SSF #1.</p>
