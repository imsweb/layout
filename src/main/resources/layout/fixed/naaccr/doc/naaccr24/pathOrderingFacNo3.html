<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Facility ID number of the facility where the specimen described in the third path report was removed/collected.</p>
<p>Use the National Provider Identifier (NPI) if possible. Otherwise, use a number defined by the American Hospital Association (AHA), or some other standard-setting organization such as the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).</p>
<p>This item accommodates only one path report; if additional path reports were prepared, enter the facility ID number(s) in Path Ordering Fac No 4 through Path Ordering Fac No 5 [7193-7194]. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7012, 7092, 7102, 7322, and 7482.</p>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>The facility where the specimen was obtained is most likely the location of the medical record for the patient as well as any residual tissue.</p>
<p>Cancer registries collect cancer information from various sources including pathology laboratories. Pathology reports of different types may be sent via HL7 messages. Included here are data items coming from such a message to be included in the cancer registry database to aid in consolidating a cancer case when there is information from multiple sources. Traditionally, these data items were not part of the NAACCR Standards Volume II record layout and therefore provide a link to NAACCR Standards Volume V. <a href="http://www.naaccr.org/standardsandregistryoperations/volumev.aspx">http://www.naaccr.org/standardsandregistryoperations/volumev.aspx</a></p>
