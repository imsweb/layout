<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>PR (Progesterone Receptor) Summary is a summary of results from the progesterone receptor (PR) assay.</p>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>This data item is required for prognostic stage grouping in AJCC 8th edition, Chapter 48, <em>Breast</em>. It was previously collected as Breast CS SSF # 2.</p>

<p>Note 1: Physician statement of PR (Progesterone Receptor) Summary status can be used to code this data item when no other information is available.</p>
<p>Note 2: The result of the PR test performed on the primary breast tissue is to be recorded in this data item.</p>
<p>Note 3: Results from nodal or metastatic tissue may be used ONLY when there is no evidence of primary tumor.</p>
<p>Note 4: In cases where PR is reported on more than one breast tumor specimen, record the highest value. If any sample is positive, record as positive.</p>
<p>•    Exception: If PR is positive on an in situ specimen and PR is negative on all tested invasive specimens, code PR as negative (code 0).</p>
<p>Note 5: If neoadjuvant therapy is given, record the assay from tumor specimens prior to neoadjuvant therapy.</p>
<p>  • If neoadjuvant therapy is given and there are no PR results from pre-treatment specimens, report the findings from post-treatment specimens.</p>
<p>Note 6: If the patient is PR positive and node negative, a multigene test such as Oncotype Dx may be performed, in which case another PR test will be performed. Do not record the results of that test in this field.</p>
<p>  • Record only the results of the test which made the patient eligible to be given the multigene test.  </p>
<p>Each Site-Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and years of diagnosis. Depending on applicability and standard-setter requirements, SSDIs may be left blank.</p>
