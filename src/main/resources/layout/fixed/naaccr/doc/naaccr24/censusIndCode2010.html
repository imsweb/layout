<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Code for the patient's usual industry, using U.S. Census Bureau codes and NIOSH non-paid worker codes. This data item applies only to patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Usual industry refers to the type of activity at the patient's place of work for most of his or her working life. Formerly Census Ind Code 2010.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Use of a standard industry classification system and associated codes improves the consistency of data collected from multiple sources and facilitates the use of data by researchers.</p>

</div>


<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p><strong>Coding Instructions</strong></p>
<p>Occupation/industry coding should NOT be performed by reporting facilities. This is a central cancer registry data item. Specially trained and qualified personnel should perform coding.<br />
 <br />
Codes for industry are routinely updated to include new or more detailed codes. The 4-digit 2010 industry codes from the U.S. Census Bureau and NIOSH are the most recent codes for industry. When assigning industry codes, central registries should use the most recent code set available. The industry codes for 2010 may be used for earlier diagnosis years. Cases already coded with older industry codes do not have to be recoded to the 2010 codes.</p>

<p>The Division of Safety Research at CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed new web-based software for automated coding of industry and occupation to appropriate year Census (1990, 2000, or 2010) classifications. This system also includes the NIOSH non-paid worker codes. See the following website for the NIOSH Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System (NIOCCS) to look up a single industry and occupation code, crosswalk a single record, or create an account to perform batch processing: &lt;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coding/code.html&gt;.</p>
