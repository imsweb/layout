<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>

<p><em>Note:</em> For cases prior to 2010, this was a 2 character field in CS version 1 which was converted to a 3 character field in CS version 2. Most 2 character codes were converted by adding a zero as the third character. For example, code 05 was usually converted to 050, 10 to 100, 11 to 110, etc. Special codes such as 88 and 99 were usually converted to 888 and 999 respectively.</p>
