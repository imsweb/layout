<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>The number and street address or the rural mailing address of the follow-up contactâ€™s current usual residence. This can be used to generate a follow-up inquiry, and must correspond to the other fields in the follow-up contact address. If the patient has multiple tumors, Follow-Up Contact--No&amp;St should be the same for all tumors.</p>
<p>U.S. addresses should conform to the USPS <em>Postal Addressing Standards</em>. These standards are referenced in USPS Pub. 28, November 2000, <em>Postal Addressing Standards</em>. The current USPS Pub. 28 may be found and downloaded from the following website: <a href="http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/pubs/Pub28/pub28.pdf">http://pe.usps.gov/cpim/ftp/pubs/Pub28/pub28.pdf</a>.</p>

<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Sometimes registries carry out follow-up by contacting the patient and other contacts by a letter or phone call to ascertain their vital status. When a patient's current address is unknown or the patient is for some reason not to be contacted (e.g., patient is a minor child), the most current name, address and phone number of another contact, such as a relative or neighbor are needed. This information may also be useful for conducting research studies.</p>
