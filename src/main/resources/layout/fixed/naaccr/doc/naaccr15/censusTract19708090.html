<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Code for the census tract or BNA of the patient&#8217;s residence at the time of diagnosis. SEER used this field for tumors reported before 1998. If the patient has more than one tumor, the codes may be different for each tumor.
    <br/><br/>Codes are those used by the U.S. Census Bureau. Census Bureau codes for BNA also are entered in this field.
    <br/><br/>Both census tracts and BNAs have a 4-digit basic number and also may have a 2-digit suffix. Census tract numbers range from 0001.00 to 9499.99. BNA numbers range from 9501.00 to 9989.99. See the Census Bureau&#8217;s &#8220;Area Classifications&#8221;<sup>35</sup> for further details.

<div class='content chap10-para'><strong>Clarification of NPCR Required Status</strong>
    <br/>Information on census tract, census tract certainty, and census tract coding system is required. Tumors diagnosed in 2003 or later, must be coded to the 2000 census definitions and recorded in Census Tract 2000 [130] and Census Tr Certainty 2000 [365]. Tumors diagnosed in 2002, or before must be coded to the 2000 census tract definitions OR to 1990 definitions OR to both the 2000 and 1990 census definitions. Census tract, census tract certainty and census tract coding system should be recorded in the year appropriate data item fields. For tumors diagnosed between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2002, (inclusive) use of the 2000 census tract definitions is recommended.
