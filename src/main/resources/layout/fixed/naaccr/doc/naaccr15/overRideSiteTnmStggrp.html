<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct.
    <br/><br/>

    <div>This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the override flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See Chapter IV, Recommended Data Edits and Software Coordination of Standards.<strong><br/><br/>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</strong><br/>Edits of the type Primary Site, AJCC Stage Group - Ed 6 and Primary Site, AJCC Stage Group - Ed 7 check that the pathologic and clinical AJCC stage group codes are valid for the site and histology group according to the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual Sixth Edition and AJCC Cancer Staging Manual Seventh Edition, using the codes described for the items TNM Clin Stage Group [970] and TNM Path Stage Group [910]. Combinations of site and histology not represented in any AJCC schema must be coded 88. Unknown stage groups must be coded 99. Blanks are not permitted.<br/><br/>Since pediatric cancers whose sites and histologies have an AJCC scheme may be coded according to a pediatric scheme instead, Override Site/TNM-Stage Group is used to indicate pediatric cases not coded according to the AJCC manual. Pediatric Stage groups should not be recorded in the TNM Clin Stage Group or TNM Path Stage Group items. When neither clinical nor pathologic AJCC staging is used for pediatric cases, code all AJCC items 88. When any components of either is used to stage a pediatric case, follow the instructions for coding AJCC items and leave Override Site/TNM-Stage Group blank.<br/><br/><strong>Instructions for Coding</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for the edits of the type Primary Site, AJCC Stage Group - Ed 6 and Primary Site, AJCC Stage Group - Ed 7.</li>
        <li>Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect.</li>
        <li>Code 1 if the case is confirmed to be a pediatric case that was coded using a pediatric coding system.</li>
