<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct.<br/><br/>Over-ride CS 20 has been designated as a flag for directly coded SEER Summary Stage 2000 [759] to support CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) requirements.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. For diagnosis years 2012 and later, NPCR permits the use of SEER Summary Stage 2000 [759] in those cases where collection of Collaborative Stage version 2 data items is not feasible due to a lack of data or staffing and time constraints at the local or central cancer registry.  Over-ride CS 20 has been designated as a special-purpose flag to identify cases where SEER Summary Stage 2000 [759] is directly coded and reported in lieu of Derived SS2000 [3020], in accordance with NPCR reporting requirements.<br/><br/>The Over-ride CS 20 value of "1", set by the user, identifies a record with NAACCR data item 759 used to report Summary Stage 2000 as permitted by NPCR requirements only; Over-ride CS 20 is left blank for all other cases.
