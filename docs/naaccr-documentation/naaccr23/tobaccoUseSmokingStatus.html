<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div><div class='content chap10-para'>Record the patient's past or current use of tobacco (cigarette, cigar and/or pipe). Tobaccos smoking history can be obtained from sections such as the Nursing Interview Guide, Flow Chart, Vital Stats or Nursing Assessment section, or other available source from the patient's hospital medical record or physician office record.</div><div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div><div class='content chap10-para'>Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the US and a major risk factor for cancer.  Reducing tobacco use is a focus of CDC's National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion.  Reliable registry-based tobacco use data will help public health planners and clinicians target populations of cancer survivors for tobacco cessation.  In addition, individual states have reported smoking data on patients are a useful covariate risk factor for cancer cluster investigations. Some state central cancer registries collect tobacco use data, but these variables are not standardized among registries.  In addition to describing tobacco use patterns and trends in patients diagnosed with cancer, the collection of cigarette smoking history can enable researchers to better understand the association of cigarette smoking to cancer outcomes. Cigarette use data at diagnosis may help health professionals better understand how tobacco use impacts cancer prognosis, including how smoking is related to effectiveness of treatment and survival. In addition, this information is important to target and assess tobacco control efforts to cancer survivors and their families.</div><div class='content chap10-para'><strong>Code</strong></div><div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'><table><tr class='code-row'><td class='code-nbr'>0</td><td class='code-desc'>Never smoker </td></tr><tr class='code-row'><td class='code-nbr'>1</td><td class='code-desc'>Current smoker</td></tr><tr class='code-row'><td class='code-nbr'>2</td><td class='code-desc'>Former smoker</td></tr><tr class='code-row'><td class='code-nbr'>3</td><td class='code-desc'>Smoker, current status unknown</td></tr><tr class='code-row'><td class='code-nbr'>9</td><td class='code-desc'>Unknown if ever smoked</td></tr><tr class='code-row'><td class='code-nbr'></td><td class='code-desc'> </td></tr></table></div>
