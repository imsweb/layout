<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.reportingFacilityRestrictionFlag<br/><br/>


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div><div class='content chap10-para'>This data item will flag tumor records that the central cancer registry may not be allowed to release for research and certain other types of uses due to the reporting facility (e.g., VA, DoD, interstate exchange). It is important to note that all cases, regardless of the reporting facility, can be released for routine surveillance reporting to NCI, CDC, and NAACCR, for which all reportable tumor records are to be submitted. This item will be used in combination with another newly proposed data item for &#8220;No Patient Contact Flag&#8221; to identify data that the registry may not be allowed to release.

<br />
</div><div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div><div class='content chap10-para'><p class="MsoNormal">Cancer registries have an obligation to manage the appropriate use and release of cancer data received from reporting facilities. Some reporting facilities (e.g., VA, DoD, interstate exchange) have restrictions about when the receiving central registry is allowed to release of data reported by their facility. Often times these restrictions depend on the agreements between the central registry and the reporting facility and focus on patient contact studies, research, and certain other types of studies that involve release of PII. These restrictions do not apply to release of data for routine surveillance activities.<br /><br />It is essential to have a standard way for central registries to identify and exclude potentially non-releasable records from a file that is transmitted to external parties for purposes other than routine surveillance.  Currently, there is no standard data item to flag records that are potentially non-releasable based on the reporting facility and the methods to identify these records differ between registries.  Many central registries have already been capturing information on potentially non-releasable records, but not in a standard manner.  Registries have captured this content using various codes and various fields such as Unusual Follow Up Method [1850] or the State Requestor field, which will be retired in v22. For those registries that do not have a specific data item, queries on the reporting facilities are run to identify non-releasable records. This newly proposed data item will provide a standard and more efficient way for registries to flag records that potentially should not be released based on the reporting facilities.<br /></p>

The code is also assigned if the tumor record is reported by both a facility without restrictions and a facility listed below that potentially has restrictions.
