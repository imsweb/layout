<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div><div class='content chap10-para'>Data linkages between the NPCR and the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection (NBCCED) and/or Colorectal Cancer Early Detection (CRCED) programs are to capture post-linkage information at the patient and tumor level.  Information on the fact (Early Detection Program Minimum Data Element (EDP MDE) Link variable) is to be reported in the EDP MDE Link data item and the date that linkage was conducted is to be reported in the EDP MDE Link Date data item.  For reportable breast, cervical, and colorectal cancer cases, use the EDP MDE Link Date variable to record results from the registry&#8217;s data linkage with the appropriate NBCCEDP/CRCEDP program(s) in the state/territory/jurisdiction.  The EDP MDE Link Date variable identifies the date that breast, cervical, or colorectal cancer cases in the registry database matched the same patient and tumor in the NBCCEDP/CRCEDP data set, indicating that the cancer was identified through that screening program (i.e.; patient Jane Doe right breast infiltrating duct carcinoma diagnosed in 2004 in the registry database matched the same Jane Doe right breast infiltrating duct carcinoma diagnosed in 2004 in the NBCCEDP data set).</div><div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div><div class='content chap10-para'>This data item records the date cancers first linked with data from the screening programs and allows analyses to evaluate trends, identify disparities, and evaluate program success. This linkage process also has the potential to identify cancers not reported or reported late to the cancer registry.</div>
