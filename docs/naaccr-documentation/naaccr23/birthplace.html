<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div><div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Code for place of birth of the patient. If a patient has multiple tumors, all records should contain the same code.</div><div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div><div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Place of Birth is helpful for patient matching and can be used when reviewing race and ethnicity. In addition, adding birthplace data to race and ethnicity allows for a more specific definition of the population being reported. Careful descriptions of ancestry, birthplace, and immigration history of populations studied are needed to make the basis for classification into ethnic groups clear. Birthplace has been associated with variation in genetic, socioeconomic, cultural, and nutritional characteristics that affect patterns of disease. A better understanding of the differences within racial and ethnic categories also can help states develop effective, culturally sensitive public health prevention programs to decrease the prevalence of high-risk behaviors and increase the use of preventive services.<br /><br />Note: For cases diagnosed January 1, 2013, and later, Birthplace--State [252] and Birthplace--Country [254] replace Birthplace [250].</div><div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'><div><strong>Codes:</strong></div><div>See Appendix B for numeric and alphabetic lists of places and codes (also see Appendix B of the SEER Program Code Manual.)</div></div>
