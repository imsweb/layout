The documentation used to be included in the library (all versions). But that really increased the size of the library 
and other than File*Pro, no software needed the old versions (as far as I know). 

And so I decided to "archive" the documentation files and use those externally in File*Pro. The library still
contains the documentation for the last 2 versions. To be consistent, I added all the versions to the archive folder.
