<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.p16<br/><br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>The p16 biomarker is over-expressed (produced) in response to HPV. It is therefore a surrogate marker for HPV disease.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Patients with HPV have a different survival or outcome so it is important to be able to distinguish this by documenting the p16 results. Testing is performed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) which is inexpensive and has near universal availability. It has an easily standardized interpretation. HPV testing is usually performed through DNA testing which is more expensive and less widely available. HPV testing also has technically more variability with the interpretation.</p>

<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>p16 is a tumor suppressor protein also known as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A. The p16 biomarker is over-expressed (produced) in response to HPV. It is therefore a surrogate marker for HPV disease.</p>
