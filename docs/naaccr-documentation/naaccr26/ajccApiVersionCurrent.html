<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>This item indicates the version of the AJCC TNM API incorporated into the cancer registry software that created the record with TNM staging data in the 8th and later versions. It should be recorded the first time the AJCC Release ID (including a value of 08.01.00) is determined and should be updated each time the related input fields listed below are modified. If the registry software incorporates the AJCC API directly, the value is obtained from AJCC’s API.  If the software instead incorporates AJCC’s Cancer Surveillance API, the value can be returned from there. The value indicates the most recent time at least one of the related input items listed below was modified.<br />
 <br />
A valid value is required for all cases diagnosed 2018 or later that have values entered in the AJCC or related data items. Cases abstracted prior to implementation of this data item will be assigned a value of 08.XX.XX during the conversion to v21.</p>
