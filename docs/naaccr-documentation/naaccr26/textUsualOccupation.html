<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.textUsualOccupation<br/><br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Text area for information about the patient’s usual occupation, also known as usual type of job or work.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Used to identify new work-related health hazards; serves as an additional measure of socioeconomic status; identifies occupational groups in which cancer screening or prevention activities may be beneficial.</p>
<p>The data item “usual occupation” is defined identically as on death certificates and conforms to the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death.&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> See related materials in reference list, Chapter VII. </p>
<p><strong>Abstracting Instructions</strong><br />
Record the patient’s usual occupation (i.e., the kind of work performed during most of the patient’s working life before diagnosis of this tumor). Do not record “retired.” If usual occupation is not available or is unknown, record the patient’s current or most recent occupation, or any available occupation.</p>
<p>If later documentation in the patient’s record provides an occupation that is more likely to be the usual occupation than what was originally recorded, facility registrars are encouraged to update the abstract with the new information. However, it is not the responsibility of the facility registrars to update abstracts with occupation information provided on death certificates. Comparison with death certificate information should be the function of a central or regional registry.</p>
<p>If the patient was a homemaker and also worked outside the home during most of his/her adult life, record the usual occupation outside the home; if the patient was a homemaker and did not work outside the home for most of his/her adult life, record “homemaker.” If the patient was not a student or homemaker and had never worked, record “never worked” as the usual occupation.</p>
<p>If no information is available, record “unknown.”</p>
<p>This data item usually is collected only for patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis.</p>
