<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.textUsualIndustry<br/><br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Text area for information about the patient’s usual industry, also known as usual kind of business/industry.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Used to identify new work-related health hazards; serves as an additional measure of socioeconomic status; identifies industrial groups or worksite-related groups in which cancer screening or prevention activities may be beneficial.</p>
<p>The data item “usual industry” is defined identically as on death certificates and conforms to the 1989 revision of the U.S. Standard Certificate of Death.&nbsp;<sup>25</sup> See related materials in reference list, Chapter VII. </p>
<p><strong>Abstracting Instructions</strong><br />
Record the primary type of activity carried on by the business/industry at the location where the patient was employed for the most number of years before diagnosis of this tumor. Be sure to distinguish among “manufacturing,” “wholesale,” “retail,” and “service” components of an industry that performs more than one of these components.</p>
<p>If the primary activity carried on at the location where the patient worked is unknown, it may be sufficient for facility registrars to record the name of the company (with city or town) in which the patient performed his/her usual industry. In these situations, if resources permit, a central or regional registry may be able to use the employer name and city/town to determine the type of activity conducted at that location.</p>
<p>As noted in the Text--Usual Occupation [310] section, in those situations where the usual occupation is not available or is unknown, the patient’s current or most recent occupation is recorded, if available. The information for industry should be based upon the information in occupation. Therefore, if current or most recent occupation rather than usual occupation was recorded, record the patient’s current or most recent business/industry.</p>
<p>If later documentation in the patient’s record provides an industry that is more likely to be the usual industry than what was originally recorded, facility registrars are encouraged to update the abstract with the new information. However, it is not the responsibility of the facility registrars to update abstracts with industry information provided on death certificates. Comparison with death certificate information should be the function of a central or regional registry.</p>
<p>There should be an entry for Text--Usual Industry if any occupation is recorded. If no information is available regarding the industry in which the reported occupation was carried out, record “unknown.” If the patient was not a student or homemaker and had never worked, record “never worked” as the usual industry. This data item usually is collected only for patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis.</p>
