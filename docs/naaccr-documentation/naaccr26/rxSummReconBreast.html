<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Records the reconstruction procedure immediately following resection performed at any facility. This data item is required beginning with diagnosis year 2024 and breast cases only.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Breast reconstruction was previously collected within the breast surgery codes. CoC will collect this data item to support the Synoptic Operative Reports and allow for more descriptive reconstruction codes.</p>
