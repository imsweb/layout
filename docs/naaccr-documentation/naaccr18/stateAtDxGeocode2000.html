<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Code for the state of the patient's residence at the time the tumor was diagnosed is a derived (geocoded) variable based on Census Boundary files from 2000 Decennial Census.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'><!--[if gte mso 10]>  <![endif]-->Populating the GeoLocationID - 2000 [352] correctly requires FIPS code for state and not the USPS abbreviations. Also, on rare occasions, the boundaries of states do change (North Carolina and South Carolina border, for example).</div>

    <div>
        <ul>
            <li>This variable is generated through the process of geocoding either during abstracting or at the central registry level. For U.S. residents, this data item stores the county codes issued by the Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) publication Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas. The information in this publication is available in Appendix A.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that geocoding be performed using the NAACCR geocoder.</li>
            <li>It is recommended that all cases diagnosed through 2009 should have a State at DX Geocode 2000 [82].</li>
            <li>At a minimum, all cases diagnosed through 1995-2009 should have a State at DX Geocode 2000. Some cases, such as those diagnosed in 2009, must have both State at DX Geocode 2000 [82] and State at DX Geocode 2010 [353] codes for proper assignment of the Census Tr Poverty Indicatr [145].</li>
            <li>Do not update this item if the patient&#8217;s residence changes. Store address update information in the affiliated current address data items. Only update based on improved information on the residential address at time of diagnosis.</li>
            <li>PO Box address information should not be used to geocode this data item except in the infrequent case when no other address information is available.</li>
            <li>If the patient has multiple tumors, the county codes may be different for each tumor. <br/></li>

    <em>Note</em>: For U.S. residents, historically, standard codes are those of the FIPS publication "Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas." These FIPS codes (FIPS 6-4) have been replaced by INCITS standard codes, however, there is no impact on this variable as the codes align with the system the Census used for each decennial census and will automatically be accounted for during geocoding.
