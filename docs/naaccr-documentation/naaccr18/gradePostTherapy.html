<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.gradePostTherapy<br/><br/>


<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This data item records the grade of a solid primary tumor that has been resected following neoadjuvant therapy. If AJCC staging is being assigned, the tumor must have met the surgical resection requirements in the AJCC manual.
    <br/><br/>Record the highest grade documented from the surgical treatment resection specimen of the primary site following neoadjuvant therapy.
    <br/><br/>For cases diagnosed January 1, 2018, and later, this data item, along with Grade Clinical and Grade Pathological, replaces NAACCR Data Item Grade [440] as well as SSF&#8217;s for cancer sites with alternative grading systems (e.g., breast [Bloom-Richardson], prostate [Gleason]).
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Grade is a measure of the aggressiveness of the tumor. Grade and cell type are important prognostic indicators for many cancers. For some sites, grade is required to assign the post-neoadjuvant stage group.<br/><br/>For those cases that are eligible AJCC staging, the recommended grading system is specified in the AJCC Chapter. The AJCC Chapter-specific grading systems (codes 1-5) take priority over the generic grade definitions (codes A-E, L, H, 9). For those cases that are not eligible for AJCC staging, if the recommended grading system is not documented, the generic grade definitions would apply.

<div class='content chap10-para'><strong>Codes (Refer to the most recent version of the SSDI Manual for additional site-specific instructions)</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Each Site-Specific Data Item (SSDI) applies only to selected primary sites, histologies, and years of diagnosis. Depending on applicability and standard-setter requirements, SSDIs may be left blank. Leave blank for cases diagnosed prior to 2018.</div>
