<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>
    <p>Provides a unique identifier for the patient consisting of the year in which the patient was first seen at the reporting facility and the consecutive order in which the patient was abstracted.</p>
    <p></p>The first four numbers specify the year and the last five numbers are the numeric order in which the patient was entered into the registry database. Within a registry, all primaries for an individual must have the same accession number. The first four digits must be greater than or equal to 1944.
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>This data item protects the identity of the patient and allows cases to be identified on a local, state, and national level. If the central registry preserves this number, they can refer to it when communicating with the reporting facilities. It also provides a way to link computerized follow-up reports from reporting facilities into the central database.</div>
