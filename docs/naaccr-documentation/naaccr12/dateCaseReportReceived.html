<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Date the abstract (or source record) is received by the central cancer registry for the respective tumor. If multiple reports are received from two or more sources and if a single date is needed, use the date the first abstract (or source record) was received from any source. See page 99 for date format.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This item is used to assess and monitor the timeliness of reporting. Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) is a concern for all standard-setting organizations. This item can be used with the Date of 1st Contact [580] or the Path--Date of Specimen Collection [7320] to measure timeliness of reporting to central cancer registries by individual reporting facilities. This data item also can be used with the Date Tumor Record Availbl [2113] to measure timeliness of processing within the central cancer registry.
