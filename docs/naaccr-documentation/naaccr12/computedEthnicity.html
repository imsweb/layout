<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Code identifying those cases for which ethnicity was determined by matching Name--Last [2230] and Name--Maiden [2390] to a computer list of Spanish/Hispanic names or by a software algorithm. This field was adopted for use for tumors diagnosed 1994 forward.<br/>
<br/>
See also Computed Ethnicity Source [210].

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
One method of identifying persons of Hispanic origin is to apply a standard computer list or algorithm to items 2230 and 2390, the patient's surname and/or maiden name. This has advantages across large populations of being reproducible and facilitating comparisons between areas using identical methods. It may sometimes be possible to identify population denominators in which the same method was used to identify Hispanics. Generally, only central registries will have this capability.<br/>
<br/>
This field provides coding to indicate both that such a computerized name-based method was applied and the results of the method. Coding is independent of that in Spanish/Hispanic Origin [190]. The computer-derived ethnicity may be different from the ethnicity reported by registries in Spanish/Hispanic Origin [190] as code 7 (Spanish Surname Only), because that field may include manual review. This field shows the results of computer-derived ethnicity only.

<br/><i>Note:</i> For SEER, blanks are required for all cases diagnosed before 1994 and blanks are not allowed for any case diagnosed 1994 and after. Other registries may have computed this item for earlier years.<br/>
<br/>
<i>Note:</i> NAACCR recognizes that available definitions and abstracting instructions for the data items Name--Last and Name--Maiden may be inadequate for describing names used in some cultures, including Hispanic cultures. Explicit instructions have not been provided for entering compound names, with or without hyphens or "De." Order of names, use of maternal and paternal names, and use of hyphens can vary across cultures. It is likely, too, that abstracting and coding practice for these items varies across registries. Limitations inherent in these definitions should be kept in mind in any use of the data.
