<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Date of initiation for hormone therapy that is part of the first course of treatment. See also RX Summ--Hormone [1400]. See page 99 for date format.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The dates on which different treatment modalities were started are used to evaluate whether the treatments were part of first-course therapy and to reconstruct the sequence of first-course treatment modes.

<br/><br/><i>Note:</i> CoC discontinued support of this item from 2003 through 2009.
