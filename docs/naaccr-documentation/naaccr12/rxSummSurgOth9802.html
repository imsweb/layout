<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Records the surgical removal of distant lymph nodes or other tissue(s)/organ(s) beyond the primary site given at all facilities as part of the first course of treatment. This field is to be used for <i>ROADS</i> codes after the <i>ROADS</i> to <i>FORDS</i> conversion. It is also to be used to code Surgery Regional/Distant Sites at all facilities for all tumors diagnosed before January 1, 2003.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The removal of non-primary tissue documents the extent of surgical treatment and is useful in evaluating the extent of metastatic involvement.

<br/><br/><b>Codes (See the CoC ROADS Manual 1998 Supplement and the SEER Program Code Manual for site-specific codes.)</b><br/>
