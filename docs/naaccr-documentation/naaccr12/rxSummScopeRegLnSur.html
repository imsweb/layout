<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Describes the removal, biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event at all facilities.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
In evaluating quality-of-care and treatment practices it is important to identify the removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event.

<br/><i>Note:</i> One important use of registry data is the tracking of treatment patterns over time. To compare contemporary treatment to previously published treatment based on former codes, or to data unmodified from pre-1998 definitions, the ability to differentiate surgeries in which four or more regional lymph nodes are removed is desirable. However, it is very important to note that the distinction between codes 4 and 5 is made to permit comparison of current surgical procedures with procedures coded in the past when the removal of fewer than 4 nodes was not reflected in surgery codes. It is not intended to reflect clinical significance when applied to a particular surgical procedure. It is important to avoid inferring, by data presentation or other methods, that one category is preferable to another within the intent of these items.
