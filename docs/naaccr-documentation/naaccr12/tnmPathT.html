<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Detailed site-specific codes for the pathologic tumor (T) as defined by AJCC and recorded by the physician.<br/>
<br/>
Pathologic and clinical stage data are given three separate areas in the NAACCR Data Exchange Record Layout.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
CoC requires that AJCC TNM staging be used in its approved cancer programs. AJCC developed its staging system for evaluating trends in the treatment and control of cancer. This staging is used by physicians to estimate prognosis, to plan treatment, to evaluate new types of therapy, to analyze outcome, to design follow-up strategies, and to assess early detection results.
