<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Identifies the regional lymph nodes involved with cancer at the time of diagnosis.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The involvement of specific regional lymph nodes is a prognostic indicator used by Collaborative Staging to derive some TNM-N codes and SEER Summary Stage codes.

<br/><br/><b>Codes (See the most current version of the <i>Collaborative Stage Data Collection System</i> (<a href="http://cancerstaging.org" target="_blank">http://cancerstaging.org</a>), for rules and site-specific codes and coding structures.)</b><br/>
<br/><i>Note:</i> For cases prior to 2010, this was a 2 character field in CS version 1 which was converted to a 3 character field in CS version 2. Most 2 character codes were converted by adding a zero as the third character. For example, code 05 was usually converted to 050, 10 to 100, 11 to 110, etc. Special codes such as 88 and 99 were usually converted to 888 and 999 respectively.
