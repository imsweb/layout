<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Identifies the surgical procedure(s) performed in an effort to diagnose and/or stage disease at this facility.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This data item is used to track the use of surgical procedure resources that are not considered treatment.<br/>
<br/>
If central registries wish to study the procedures performed at particular facilities, the facility-level fields must be used. The summary fields, conversely, combine information for all facilities that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and diagnostic/staging procedures by type of healthcare setting. Knowing what part of the diagnostic or staging process was performed at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.

<br/><i>Note</i>: This item has been used for tumors diagnosed in 1996 and later. For cases diagnosed before 1996, this item may have been converted from the <i>DAM</i>, and cases with surgery would have been converted to 09 in this field. For cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2002, this field may have described palliative care according to coding rules in <i>ROADS</i>. For tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2003, palliative care is coded in a new field RX Hosp--Palliative Proc [3280].
