<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Codes for surgical procedures done to reconstruct, restore, or improve the shape and appearance or function of body structures that are missing, defective, damaged, or misshapen by cancer or therapies. Reconstructive/restorative procedures are coded here when started during the first course of therapy. <br/>
<br/>
CoC introduced site-specific codes for this item in the CoC <i>ROADS Manual</i> 1998 Supplement. RX Coding System--Current [1460] identifies which coding system applies.<br/>
<br/>
SEER collects reconstructive procedures for breast cancer tumors only.<br/>
<br/>
For reconstructive/restorative procedures performed later, see Subseq RX--Reconstruct Del [1741]. See also RX Summ--Surgery Type [1640].

<br/><br/><i>Note:</i> This data item is no longer supported by CoC (as of January 1, 2003).
