<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
The NPI (National Provider Identifier) code that records the registry responsible for following the patient.<br/>
<br/>
NPI, a unique identification number for US health care providers, was scheduled for 2007-2008 implementation by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) as part of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA). For billing purposes, large practices and large group providers were required to use NPI codes by May 2007; small health plans were required to use NPI codes by May 2008.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The NPI equivalent of Following Registry [2440].

<br/><br/><b>Codes [Only valid NPI assigned 10-digit numeric codes (9-digit number plus 1 check digit). The check digit algorithm is available at: <a href="https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/NPPES/NPIRegistryHome.do" target="_blank">https://nppes.cms.hhs.gov/NPPES/NPIRegistryHome.do</a>.]</b><br/>
