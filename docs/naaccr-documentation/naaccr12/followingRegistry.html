<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Records the FIN of the registry responsible for following the patient.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Each FIN is unique. The number is essential to NCDB for monitoring data submissions, ensuring the accuracy of data, and identifying areas for special studies.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Instructions for Coding</b><br/>
CoC maintains the codes, including those for non-hospital sources of reporting. <br/>
<br/>
For facilities with 7-digit FINs, consisting of a constant "6" followed by 6-digit facility-specific codes in the range of 6020009-6953290 that were assigned by CoC before January 1, 2001: Enter all FIN codes of this type as 3 zeroes, followed by the constant "6" and the 6-digit facility-specific codes.<br/>
<br/>
For facilities with FINs greater than or equal to 10000000 that were assigned by CoC after January 1, 2001: Enter FIN codes of this type as 2 zeroes followed by the full 8-digit code. These sometimes are called CoC FIN 10 digit codes.
