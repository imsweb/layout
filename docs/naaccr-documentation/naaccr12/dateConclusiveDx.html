<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Documents the date when a conclusive cancer diagnosis (definite statement of malignancy) is made following an initial diagnosis that was based only on ambiguous terminology. See page 99 for date format. Use DATE CONCLUSIVE DX FLAG [448] if there is no appropriate or known date for this item.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This date will allow analysis of the primary site locations and frequency of cases that were originally diagnosed by ambiguous terminology and later confirmed by other conclusive method.<br/>
<br/>
This date will also allow for analysis of the time interval between cancer diagnosis based on ambiguous terminology and confirmation of the cancer diagnosis by conclusive means.
