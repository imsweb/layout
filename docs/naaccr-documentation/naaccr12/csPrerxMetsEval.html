<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This data item belongs to the Collaborative Stage (CS) Data Collection System which is based on the <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</i>, 6th and 7th editions. The CS pre-treatment data items include all information prior to the start of therapy. In rare circumstances where workup could not be completed prior to therapy, these items may be based on testing after limited treatment in the absence of progression or regression of disease, such as delayed planned or usual diagnostic workup. This does not include diagnostic workup for progression of disease or regression. The implementation of this data item has been deferred indefinitely.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The CS pre-treatment data items will record the pre-treatment (clinical) stage. This is used for analysis of appropriate treatment selection. These items are a companion to the AJCC clinical stage information required by CoC, and likely will eventually replace the required AJCC staging. Codes are exactly the same as the regular CS codes. For these data fields, the eval fields also remain the same although the valid options will be limited by edits, in order to use the same tables in CS. The pre-treatment data items will be used for analysis of the effectiveness of neoadjuvant therapy.
