<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This field is provided for coding the block group of patient's residence at time of diagnosis, as defined by the 2010 Census.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
A block group is a subdivision of a census tract designed to have an average of 1500 people, versus a census tract's average of 4500 people. All land area in the United States is described by a census block group in the 2010 Census. The Census Bureau publishes detailed population and socioeconomic data at this level. Block groups thus offer a high level of specificity for geographical and socioeconomic analyses.<br/>
<br/>
A block group has no meaning in the absence of a census tract. Refer to Census Tr Certainty 2010 [367] to ascertain basis of assignment of Census Block Group 2010.

<br/><i>Note:</i> The values 1 through 9 are nominal, with no hierarchy of values. This number determines the first digit of all the blocks which comprise the block group; for instance, census block group 3 would contain blocks numbered 3000 to 3999.
<br/><br/><b>Comment</b><br/>
Numerous registries find the distinction between "attempted, could not be determined" (zero) and "not coded" (blank) to be useful for geocoding planning purposes.
