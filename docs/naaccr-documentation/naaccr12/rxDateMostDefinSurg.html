<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Date of most definitive surgical resection of the primary site performed as part of the first course of treatment. See page 99 for date format. Use RX DATE MST DEFN SRG FLAG [3171] if there is no appropriate or known date for this item.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This item is used to measure lag time between diagnosis and the most definitive surgery of the primary site or survival following the procedure. It also is used in conjunction with Date of Surgical Discharge [3180] to calculate the duration of hospitalization following the most definitive primary site surgical procedure to evaluate treatment efficacy.
