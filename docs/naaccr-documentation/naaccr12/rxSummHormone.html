<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Records whether systemic hormonal agents were administered as first-course treatment at any facility, or the reason they were not given. Hormone therapy consists of a group of drugs that may affect the long-term control of a cancer's growth. It is not usually used as a curative measure.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Systemic therapy may involve the administration of one or a combination of agents. This data item allows for the evaluation of the administration of hormonal agents as part of the first course of therapy.
