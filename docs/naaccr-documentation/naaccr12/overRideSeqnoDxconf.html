<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct. <br/>
<br/>
This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Diagnostic Confirm, Seq Num--Central (SEER IF23)

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Some edits check for code combinations that are impossible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See Chapter IV, Recommended Data Edits and Software Coordination of Standards.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</b><br/>
<ul><li>The edit checks if the case is one of multiple primaries and is not microscopically confirmed or has only positive lab test/marker studies (i.e., Diagnostic Confirmation &gt; 5) and tumor sequence number &gt; 00 (more than one primary). </li>
<li>The edit is skipped if the Sequence Number--Central is in the range of 60-99.</li></ul><br/>
<br/>
<b>Instructions for Coding</b><br/>
<ul><li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for the Diagnostic Confirmation and Sequence Number Central edit.</li>
<li>Code 1 if the cases have been reviewed and it is verified that there are multiple primaries of specific sites in which at least one diagnosis has not been microscopically confirmed.</li></ul>
