<br/>
This item accommodates only one path report; if additional path reports were prepared, enter the facility ID number(s) in Path Ordering Fac No 2 through Path Ordering Fac No 5 [7191-7194]. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7010, 7090, 7100, and 7480.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Describes the origin of the first pathology report contributing to this cancer abstract. The facility where the specimen was obtained is most likely the location of the medical record for the patient as well as any residual tissue.
