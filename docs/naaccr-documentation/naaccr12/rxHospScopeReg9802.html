<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Describes the removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event at the reporting facility. This field is to be used for <i>ROADS</i> codes after the <i>ROADS</i> to <i>FORDS</i> conversion. It is also to be used to code Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery at the reporting facility for all tumors diagnosed before January 1, 2003.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
In evaluating quality of care and treatment practices it is important to identify the removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event.<br/>
<br/>
If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular hospitals, the hospital-level treatment fields must be used. The summary treatment fields, conversely, combine information across all hospitals that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Hospital-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of hospital. Knowing the extent of treatment given at a particular hospital also helps resolve coding issues.

<br/><br/><b>Codes (See the CoC <i>ROADS Manual</i> 1998 Supplement and the <i>SEER Program Code Manual</i> for site-specific codes.</b><br/>
