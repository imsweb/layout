<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This flag explains why no appropriate value is in the field, RX Date--Radiation [1210]. This data item was first available in Volume IIVersion 12 (effective January 2010).

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Before Version 12 (through 2009 diagnosis), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously been transmitted in date fields.

<br/><br/><b>Codes (See Appendix H for the complete Flavors of Null table, which includes the NAACCR codes, HL7 codes and definitions.)</b><br/>
