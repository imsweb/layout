<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct. <br/>
<br/>
This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Site, Morphology-Type ICDO2 (CoC)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Site, Morphology-Type ICDO3 (CoC)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Site, Morphology-Type ICDO2 (SEER IF25)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Site, Morphology-Type ICDO3 (SEER IF25)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Site, Morphology-Type, Behavior ICDO3 (SEER IF25)<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Primary Site, Morphology-Type, Behavior ICDO3 (CoC)

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See Chapter IV, Recommended Data Edits and Software Coordination of Standards.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</b><br/>
Multiple versions of edits of the type Primary site, Morphology-Type check for "usual" combinations of site and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology. The SEER version of the edit is more restrictive than the CoC edit, and thus uses a different over-ride flag. The CoC version of the edit will accept Over-ride CoC-Site/Type or Over-ride Site/Type as equivalent.<br/>
<ol><li>The Site/Histology validation list (available on the SEER web site) contains those histologies commonly found in the specified primary site. Histologies that occur only rarely or never are not included. These edits require review of all combinations not listed.<br/></li>
<li>Since basal and squamous cell carcinomas of non-genital skin sites are not reportable to SEER, these site/histology combinations do not appear on the SEER validation list. For the CoC version of the edit, if Primary Site is in the range C440-C449 (skin), and ICD-O-2 histology is in the range 8000-8004 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8045 (epithelial carcinomas), 8050-8082 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), or ICD-O-3 histology is in the range 8000-8005 (neoplasms, malignant, NOS), 8010-8046 (epithelial carcinomas), 8050-8084 (papillary and squamous cell carcinomas), or 8090-8110 (basal cell carcinomas), no further editing is done. No over-ride is necessary for these cases in the CoC version of the edit.<br/></li></ol>
<br/>
Review of these cases requires investigating whether a) the combination is biologically implausible, or b) there are cancer registry coding conventions that would dictate different codes for the diagnosis. Review of these rare combinations often results in changes to the primary site and/or morphology, rather than a decision that the combination is correct.<br/>
<br/>
<b>Instructions for Coding</b><br/>
<ul><li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for the edits of the type Primary Site, Morphology-Type.</li>
<li>Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect.</li>
<li>Code 1 if the case has been reviewed and both the site and histology are correct.</li></ul>
