<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This data item provides the ability to store additional address information such as the name of a place or facility, a nursing home, or the name of an apartment complex. If the patient has multiple tumors, address at diagnosis may be different for each tumor. Do not use this item for information stored in other address items such as Addr At DX--NO&amp;Street [2330].

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Sometimes the registry receives the name of a facility instead of a proper street address containing the street number, name, direction, and other elements necessary to locate an address on a street file for the purpose of geocoding. By having a second street address field to hold address information, the registry can look up and store the street address and not lose the facility name due to a shortage of space. The presence of a second street address field to hold additional address information also aids in follow-up.
