<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Date of initiation for other treatment that is part of the first course of treatment at any facility. See RX Summ--Other [1420]. See page 99 for date format.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The dates on which different treatment modalities were started are used to evaluate whether the treatments were part of first-course therapy and to reconstruct the sequence of first-course treatment modes.
