<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This flag explains why no appropriate value is in the field, Date of Conclusive DX [443]. This data item was first available in Volume II Version 12 (effective January 2010).

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Before Version 12, date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously been transmitted in date fields.

<br/><br/><b>Codes (See Appendix H for the complete Flavors of Null table, which includes the NAACCR codes, HL7 codes and definitions.)</b><br/>
