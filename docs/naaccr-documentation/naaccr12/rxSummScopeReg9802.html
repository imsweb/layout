<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Describes the removal, biopsy or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event at all facilities. This field is to be used for <i>ROADS</i> codes after the <i>ROADS</i> to <i>FORDS</i> conversion. It is also to be used to code Scope of Regional Lymph Node Surgery at all facilities for all tumors diagnosed before January 1, 2003.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
In evaluating quality of care and treatment practices it is important to identify the removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) at the time of surgery of the primary site or during a separate surgical event.

<br/><br/><b>Codes (See the CoC ROADS Manual 1998 Supplement and the SEER Program Code Manual for site-specific codes.)</b><br/>
