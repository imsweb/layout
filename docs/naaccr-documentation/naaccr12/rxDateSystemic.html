<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Date of initiation of systemic therapy that is part of the first course of treatment. Systemic therapy includes the administration of chemotherapy agents, hormone agents, biological response modifiers, bone marrow transplants, stem cell harvests, and surgical and/or radiation endocrine therapy. See page 99 for date format. Use RX DATE SYSTEMIC FLAG [3231] if there is no appropriate or known date for this item.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Collecting dates for each treatment modality allows the sequencing of multiple treatments and aids in the evaluation of time intervals from diagnosis to treatment and from treatment to recurrence.
