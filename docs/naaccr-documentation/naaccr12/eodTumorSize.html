<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Part of the 10-digit EOD [779]. Detailed site-specific codes for anatomic EOD used by SEER for tumors diagnosed from January 1, 1988, through December 31, 2003.<br/>
<br/>
This field was included in the CoC dataset, separate from EOD.<br/>
<br/>
Codes were revised effective January 1, 1998, to reflect changes in the <i>AJCC Cancer Staging Manual</i>, Fifth Edition.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Site-specific EOD codes provide extensive detail describing disease extent. The EOD codes can be grouped into different stage categories for analysis (e.g., historical summary stage categories consistent with those used in published SEER data since 1973, or more recently, AJCC stage groupings). The codes are updated as needed, but updates are usually backward compatible with old categories. See <i>Comparative Staging Guide for Cancer</i>.
