<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Name of the city of the follow-up contact's current usual residence. If the patient has multiple tumors, the follow-up contact city of residence should be the same for all tumors.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Sometimes registries carry out follow-up by contacting the patient and other contacts by a letter or phone call to ascertain their vital status. When a patient's current address is unknown or the patient is for some reason not to be contacted (e.g., patient is a minor child), the most current name, address and phone number of another contact, such as a relative or neighbor are needed. This information may also be useful for conducting research studies.
