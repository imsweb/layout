<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This data item provides the ability to store additional address information such as the name of a place or facility, a nursing home, or the name of an apartment complex. It can be used to generate a follow-up inquiry, and must correspond to the other fields in the follow-up contact address. If the patient has multiple tumors, Follow-Up Contact--Suppl should be the same for all tumors.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Sometimes registries carry out follow-up by contacting the patient and other contacts by a letter or phone call to ascertain their vital status. When a patient's current address is unknown or the patient is for some reason not to be contacted (e.g., patient is a minor child), the most current name, address and phone number of another contact, such as a relative or neighbor are needed. This information may also be useful for conducting research studies.
