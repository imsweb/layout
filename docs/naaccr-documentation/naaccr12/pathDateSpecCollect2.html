<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Records the date and time of the specimen collection for the cancer being reported, not the date read or date the report was typed.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Describes the origin of the pathology report contributing to this cancer abstract. The date that the specimen was collected is likely to correspond to the procedure date at the facility where a specimen was obtained.
