<p>Code for the patient’s usual occupation, using the <a href="https://www.census.gov/naics">North American Industry Classification System</a> (NAICS), <a href="https://www.bls.gov/soc">Standard Occupational Classification System</a> (SOC), and/or <a href="https://www.census.gov/topics/employment/industry-occupation/guidance/code-lists.html">Census Industry and Occupation Classification System</a>. Additional information on collecting and using this data are available from <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/coding/code.html">the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health</a> (NIOSH). The automated coding system available from NIOSH, Industry and Occupation Computerized Coding System (NIOCCS), is the preferred resource. NIOCCS is a free auto-coder that codes large files of industry and occupation free-text descriptions to Census industry and occupation codes, NAICS codes, and SOC codes. This data item applies only to patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Usual occupation is defined as the type of job the patient was engaged in for most of his or her working life</p>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>The usual (longest-held) occupation and industry of workers can reveal the national cancer burden by industry and occupation. Such information can also be used to help discover jobs that may have a high risk for cancer or other diseases and for which prevention efforts can be concentrated (or targeted). Coding the data allows public health officials and other researchers to assess patterns and trends in work-related diseases, injuries, and exposures.</p>

<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Note: The Division of Safety Research at CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed new web-based software for automated coding of industry and occupation to appropriate year Census (1990, 2000, or 2010) classifications. This system also includes the NIOSH non-paid worker codes. The contact person for this software is Sue Nowlin, who can be contacted at <a href="mailto:sxn1@cdc.gov">sxn1@cdc.gov</a> or (513) 841-4467.<br />
