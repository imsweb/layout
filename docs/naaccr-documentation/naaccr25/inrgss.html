<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>International Neuroblastoma Risk Group Staging System (INRGSS) for Neuroblastoma is defined based on clinical work up and image-defined risk factors. </p>
<p>The INRGSS is a clinically based staging system and is able to be utilized for every single neuroblastoma tumor as it is based on the clinical work up and image-defined risk factors</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary source of information for this data item is imaging</li>
<li>Do not code any staging information from results of surgical resection in this data item</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note</em>: There is a different staging system available for patients who have surgery (International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS)) which is collected in Pediatric Primary Tumor, Pediatric Regional Nodes, and Pediatric Mets</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>This is part of the National Childhood Cancer Registry (NCCR) project to collect more specific information on pediatric patients. Registries part of the NCCR will start collection on specific pediatric data items with 2024+ diagnoses.</p>

</ul>
<p><strong>Note 2: Image-Defined Risk Factors</strong></p>
<p>Image-Defined Risk Factors in Neuroblastic Tumors: Staging requires assessment of whether patients have none, or one or more of the image-defined risk factors (IDRF). These IDRF’s are based on imaging prior to any surgical resection or other treatment. </p>
<p>Ipsilateral tumor extension within two body compartments</p>
<p>Neck-chest, chest-abdomen, abdomen-pelvis</p>
<p>Neck</p>
<p>Tumor encasing carotid and/or vertebral artery and/or internal jugular vein</p>
<p>Tumor extending to base of skull</p>
<p>Tumor compressing the trachea</p>
<p>Cervico-thoracic junction</p>
<p>Tumor encasing brachial plexus roots</p>
<p>Tumor encasing subclavian vessels and/or vertebral and/or carotid artery</p>

<p>Tumor invading one or both renal pedicles</p>
<p>Tumor encasing the aorta and/or vena cava</p>
<p>Tumor encasing the iliac vessels</p>

<p><strong>Note 4: Ascites and pleural effusion</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Ascites and/or a pleural effusion, even with malignant cells, do not constitute metastatic disease unless they are remote from the body compartment of the primary tumor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note 5: Lymph node involvement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Regional lymph node involvement does not factor into staging</li>
