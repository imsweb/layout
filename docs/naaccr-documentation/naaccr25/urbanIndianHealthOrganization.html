<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>UIO is derived using NAACCR*Prep based on the state and county at the time of diagnosis according to the Urban Indian Health Institute Community Health Profile, National Aggregate of Urban Indian Organization Service Areas.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Data analyses restricted to UIO service areas improve the accuracy of cancer statistics for urban American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) people. UIO service areas consist of counties where AI/AN people originally lived, or where they migrated because of the Indian Relocation Act of 1956. These counties are served by the Urban Indian Health Program and other Urban Indian Organizations. This derived data item facilitates the production of incidence rates for urban American Indian and Alaska Native people.</p>
