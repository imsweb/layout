        <strong>Instructions for Coding</strong><br/>CoC maintains the codes, including those for non-hospital sources of reporting.<br/><br/>For facilities with 7-digit FINs, consisting of a constant &#8220;6&#8221; followed by 6-digit facility-specific codes in the range of 6020009-6953290 that were assigned by CoC before January 1, 2001: Enter all FIN codes of this type as 3 zeroes, followed by the constant &#8220;6&#8221; and the 6-digit facility-specific codes.<br/><br/>For facilities with FINs greater than or equal to 10000000 that were assigned by CoC after January 1, 2001: Enter FIN codes of this type as 2 zeroes followed by the full 8-digit code. These sometimes are called CoC FIN 10-digit codes.&nbsp;
