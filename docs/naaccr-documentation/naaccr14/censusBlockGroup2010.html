<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This field is provided for coding the block group of patient&#8217;s residence at time of diagnosis, as defined by the 2010 Census.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>A block group is a subdivision of a census tract designed to have an average of 1500 people, versus a census tract's average of 4500 people. All land area in the United States is described by a census block group in the 2010 Census. The Census Bureau publishes detailed population and socioeconomic data at this level. Block groups thus offer a high level of specificity for geographical and socioeconomic analyses.<br/><br/>A block group has no meaning in the absence of a census tract. Refer to Census Tr Certainty 2010 [367] to ascertain basis of assignment of Census Block Group 2010.
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para'><strong>Comment</strong>
    <br/>Numerous registries find the distinction between &#8220;attempted, could not be determined&#8221; (zero) and &#8220;not coded&#8221; (blank) to be useful for geocoding planning purposes.
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
    <em>Note:</em> The values 1 through 9 are nominal, with no hierarchy of values. This number determines the first digit of all the blocks which comprise the block group; for instance, census block group 3 would contain blocks numbered 3000 to 3999.
