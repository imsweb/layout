<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Date of first patient contact, as inpatient or outpatient, with the reporting facility for the diagnosis and/or treatment of the tumor. The date may represent the date of an outpatient visit for a biopsy, x-ray, scan, or laboratory test. See Chapter X for date format.<br/><br/>When pathology-specimen-only tumors are collected (Class of Case 43, Type of Reporting Source 3), the date of specimen collection from the pathology report should be used as the Date of 1st Contact. If a pathology-specimen-only case is followed by patient contact with a facility for diagnosis and/or treatment of the respective tumor, ACoS coding rules require the hospital registry to change the Date of 1st Contact to reflect the date the patient first registered at that facility. Central registries, however, should retain the earlier date in their consolidated files, as that shows the patient&#8217;s first recorded contact with the healthcare system for this disease.
    <br/><br/>When death certificate only (Class of Case 49, Type of Reporting Source 7) tumors are collected, the date of death should be used as the Date of 1st Contact. When Autopsy Only (Class of Case 38, Type of Reporting Source 6) tumors are collected, the date of death should be used as the Date of 1st Contact.

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) is a concern for all standard-setting organizations. Date of 1st Contact is one of several data items that can be used to measure timeliness of reporting to central cancer registries by individual facilities. For tumors that are not diagnosed at the reporting facility following its Reference Date (Class of Case 20-22, 30-37), the Date of 1st Contact [580] can be used in conjunction with the Date Case Report Received [2111] to measure timeliness of reporting by individual facilities.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
    <em>Comment</em>: To accurately measure the timeliness of data collection and submission of abstracts that are first diagnosed at autopsy (Class of Case 38, Type of Reporting Source 6) the date of death should be used as the Date of 1st Contact since the diagnosis was not determined until the autopsy was performed. Death Certificate Only cases (Class of Case 49, Type of Reporting Source 7) are created only by the central registry. For these cases, Date of 1st Contact should be filled with the date of death, and timeliness for DCO cases should be measured by different criteria.
