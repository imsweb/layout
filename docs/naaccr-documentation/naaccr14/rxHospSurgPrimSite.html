<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Describes surgical procedures used to treat the primary site of the reportable tumor. This item records that portion of the first course of treatment given at the reporting facility. See Chapter V, Unresolved Issues, for a discussion of differences in treatment coding among groups and over time.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This data item can be used to compare the efficacy of treatment options.<br/><br/>If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular facilities, the facility-level treatment fields must be used. The summary treatment fields, conversely, combine information for all hospitals that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing what part of the treatment was given at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.
