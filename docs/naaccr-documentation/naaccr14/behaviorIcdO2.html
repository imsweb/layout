<div class='content chap10-para'>Code for the behavior of the tumor being reported using ICD-O-2. NAACCR adopted ICD-O-2 as the standard coding system for tumors diagnosed from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2000. In addition, NAACCR recommended that cases diagnosed prior to 1992 be converted to ICD-O-2. See Behavior (73-91) ICD-O-1 [1972], for ICD-O-1 and field trial codes.</div>

    <strong>Clarification of Required Status</strong>This data item was required by all standard-setting organizations for tumors diagnosed from January 1, 1992, through December 31, 2000, and recommended for tumors diagnosed before 1992.<br/><br/>When the histologic type is coded according to the ICD-O-2, the histology code must be reported in Histology (92-00) ICD-O-2 [420], with behavior coded in Behavior (92-00) ICD-O-2 [430].<br/><br/>For information on required status for related data items for histologic type and behavior when coded according to ICD-O-3, see Histologic Type ICD-O-3 [522] and Behavior Code ICD-O-3 [523].
