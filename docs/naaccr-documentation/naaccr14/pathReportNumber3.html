<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
    <div>Unique sequential number assigned by a laboratory to the third report for this case.<br/><br/>This item accommodates only one path report. When information is available for more than three path reports, enter the path report number(s) in Path Report No 4 through Path Report No 5 [7093-7094]. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7012, 7102, 7192, 7322, and 7482.

    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <div>Note: In some cases the HL7 field length as sent by the laboratory may be longer than 20.<br/></div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>The pathology report number provides a cross reference that identifies the specimen at the pathology facility. It may be useful for follow back with the pathology facility.
    <div></div>
    <div>Cancer registries collect cancer information from various sources including pathology laboratories. Pathology reports of different types may be sent via HL7 messages. Included here are data items coming from such a message to be included in the cancer registry database to aid in consolidating a cancer case when there is information from multiple sources. Traditionally, these data items were not part of the NAACCR Standards Volume II record layout and therefore provide a link to NAACCR Standards Volume V.
