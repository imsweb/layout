<div class='content chap10-para'>License number of physician submitting specimens for the third path report.
    <br/><br/>This item accommodates only one path report; if additional path reports were prepared, enter the license number of physician in Path Order Phys Lic No 4 through Path Order Phys Lic No 5 [7103-7104]. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7012, 7022, 7192, 7322, and 7482.

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Cancer registries collect cancer information from various sources including pathology laboratories. Pathology reports of different types may be sent via HL7 messages. Included here are data items coming from such a message to be included in the cancer registry database to aid in consolidating a cancer case when there is information from multiple sources. Traditionally, these data items were not part of the NAACCR Standards Volume II record layout and therefore provide a link to NAACCR Standards Volume V.
