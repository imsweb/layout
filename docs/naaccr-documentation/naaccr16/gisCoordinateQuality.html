<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Code indicating the basis of assignment of latitude and longitude coordinates for an individual record from an address. This data item is helpful in identifying cases that were assigned coordinates based on incomplete information, post office boxes, or rural routes. This item is coded at the central registry, not by the reporting facility. Most of the time, this information is provided by geocoding software. Alternatively, a central registry staff member manually assigns the code. Codes are hierarchical, with lower numbers having priority.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Spatial analysis of cancer data often requires identifying data records with a high degree of geographic precision. Researchers can use this code as a basis for selecting records with a degree of precision that is appropriate to the study.</div>

    <em>Instructions for Coding:</em> Where multiple codes are applicable, use the lower code value. Note: This data item is similar in function to Census Tract Certainty 1970/80/90 [364] and Census Tract Certainty 2000 [365]. The codes for this data item and the two census tract data items all describe how location information was assigned based on the patient's resident address at the time of diagnosis.
    <br/><br/>This data item must be populated if Latitude [2352] and Longitude [2354] are also populated.
