<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Identifies treatment given at this facility that cannot be defined as surgery, radiation, or systemic therapy according to the defined data items in this manual. Treatment for reportable hematopoietic diseases can be supportive care, observation, or any treatment that does not meet the usual definition in which treatment modifies, controls, removes, or destroys proliferating cancer tissue. Supportive care such as phlebotomy, transfusions, or aspirin may be recorded for hematopoietic diseases ONLY.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Information on other therapy is used to describe treatment practices and evaluate quality of care. If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular facilities, the facility-level treatment fields must be used. The summary treatment fields, conversely, combine information for all reporting facilities that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing what part of the treatment was given at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.</div>
