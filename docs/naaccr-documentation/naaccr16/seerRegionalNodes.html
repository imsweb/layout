<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>There are a number of schemas or portions of schemas which are not staged under TNM. Under CS, these have been Summary Staged algorithmically using CS Extension, CS Lymph Nodes, and CS Mets and other information as needed. Beginning with cases diagnosed in 2016 this will no longer be the case. These three newly proposed data items will be used to simply collect information on the primary tumor, regional nodes, and mets so that a summary stage can be easily derived for these cases.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>The SEER program has collected staging information on cases since its inception in 1973. When Collaborative Stage (CS) data are no longer collected, SEER will no longer have staging information for cases which AJCC does not provide T, N, M and/or stage groups. To fill this gap, SEER is proposing to collect simplified information to be able to derive a summary stage such as in situ, localized, regional (by extension, regional nodes, or both), and distant plus unknown for the cases which have no staging information under AJCC&#8217;s criteria.</div>
