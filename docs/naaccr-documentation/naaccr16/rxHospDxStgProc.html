<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This data item is used to track the use of surgical procedure resources that are not considered treatment.<br/><br/>If central registries wish to study the procedures performed at particular facilities, the facility-level fields must be used. The summary fields, conversely, combine information for all facilities that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and diagnostic/staging procedures by type of healthcare setting. Knowing what part of the diagnostic or staging process was performed at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.
