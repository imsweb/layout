<div class='content chap10-para'>Facility ID number of the facility where the specimen described in the fourth path report was removed/collected.
    <br/><br/>Use the National Provider Identifier (NPI) if possible. Otherwise, use a number defined by the American Hospital Association (AHA), or some other standard-setting organization such as the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).<br/><br/>This item accommodates only one path report; if an additional path report was prepared, enter the facility ID number in Path Ordering Fac No 5 [7194]. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7013, 7093, 7103, 7323, and 7483.

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>The facility where the specimen was obtained is most likely the location of the medical record for the patient as well as any residual tissue.

        <br/>Cancer registries collect cancer information from various sources including pathology laboratories. Pathology reports of different types may be sent via HL7 messages. Included here are data items coming from such a message to be included in the cancer registry database to aid in consolidating a cancer case when there is information from multiple sources. Traditionally, these data items were not part of the NAACCR Standards Volume II record layout and therefore provide a link to NAACCR Standards Volume V.
