<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Code for the patient&#8217;s usual industry, using U.S. Census Bureau codes (2000 Census<sup>26</sup> is preferable) according to coding procedures recommended for death certificates.<sup>25</sup> This data item applies only to patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis.<br/><br/><em>Note:</em> Occupation/industry coding should NOT be performed by reporting facilities. This is a central cancer registry data item. Specially trained and qualified personnel should perform coding.<em><br/></em>

    <div></div>
    <div>Formerly Industry Code--Census.</div>
    <em>Note:</em> 2000 Census codes for occupation and industry are recommended for tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2003.<sup>26</sup> The 1990 Census codes are recommended for tumors diagnosed before January 1, 2003.<sup>24</sup> For more information, see the U.S. Census Bureau website at:

</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Use of the Census Bureau classification system improves consistency of data collected from multiple sources. The Census Bureau industrial classification system is used for coding industry information from death certificates and from the U.S. Census of Population. The system includes specific coding rules.

As of press time, NIOSH is developing new web-based software for automated coding of industry and occupation to appropriate year Census (1990, 2000, or 2010) classifications.
