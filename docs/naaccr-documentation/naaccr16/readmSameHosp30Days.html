<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Records a readmission to the same hospital within 30 days of discharge following hospitalization for surgical resection of the primary site for the same illness.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This data item provides information related to the quality of care. A patient may have a readmission related to the primary diagnosis on discharge if the length of stay was too short, and then needed to return due to problems or complications. A patient may also need to be readmitted if discharge planning and/or follow-up instructions were ineffective. It is important to distinguish a planned from an unplanned readmission, since a planned readmission is not an indicator of quality of care problems.</div>
