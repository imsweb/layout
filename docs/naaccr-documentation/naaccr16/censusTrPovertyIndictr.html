<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Assigns a code for neighborhood poverty level based on the census tract of diagnosis address. Cases diagnosed between 1995 and 2004 are assigned a code based on the 2000 U.S. Census, the last decennial census for which poverty level was collected. Cases diagnosed since 2005 are assigned a code based on the American Community Survey (ACS).
    <br/><br/>The ACS publishes tract-level poverty data annually, on a rolling five-year window, with a two-year lag (e.g., poverty data for 2006-2010 will be available in 2012). Cases for a given diagnosis year are initially coded using the most recent file available when the cancer data are first released, and the item is subsequently coded using the ACS file centered on the year of diagnosis. For example, cases diagnosed in 2012 will initially be coded using the 2008-2012 ACS file, and two years later using the 2010-2014 ACS file. An exception to this rule is that cases diagnosed in 2005 and 2006 will be coded using the 2005-2009 ACS file, because this was the first such file released. Codes may be automatically assigned by running the Poverty and Census Tract Linkage Program available through the Data Analysis Tools section of the NAACCR website.

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Many cancers are associated with socioeconomic status and it is useful to include a measure of this in analyses. A detailed rationale for this data item was published in
    <em>Journal of Registry Management </em>2010; 37(4): 148-151.
