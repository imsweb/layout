<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct.
    <br/><br/>This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <tab>Laterality, Primary Site, Morph ICDO2 (SEER IF42)
        <tab><br/></tab>
    </tab>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <tab>
        <tab>Laterality, Primary Site, Morph ICDO3 (SEER IF42)</tab>
    </tab>
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See Chapter IV, Recommended Data Edits and Software Coordination of Standards.<strong><br/><br/>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</strong><br/>Edits of the type Laterality, Primary Site, Morph differ in use of ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 morphology and do the following:<br/>
    <ol>
        <li>If the Primary Site is a paired organ and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 behavior is <em>in situ</em> (2), then laterality must be 1, 2, or 3.</li>
        <li>If diagnosis year less than 1988 and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology = 9590, no further editing is performed.</li>
        <li>If diagnosis year greater than 1987 and ICD-O-2 or ICD-O-3 histology = 9140, 9700, 9701, 9590-9980, no further editing is performed.</li>
    </ol>
    The intent of this edit is to force review of <em>in situ</em> cases for which laterality is coded 4 (bilateral) or 9 (unknown laterality) as to origin.
    <tab>In rare instances when the tumor is truly midline (9) or the rare combination is otherwise confirmed correct, enter a code 1 for Override Site/Lat/Morph.<br/><br/><strong>Instructions for Coding</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for the edit Laterality, Primary site, Morph ICDO2 (SEER IF 42) and/or the edit Laterality, Primary site, Morph ICDO3 (SEER IF42).</li>
            <li>Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect.</li>
            <li>Code 1 if review of site, laterality and morphology verifies that the case had behavior code of &#8220;<em>in situ</em>&#8221; and laterality is not stated as &#8220;right: origin of primary;&#8221; &#8220;left: origin of primary;&#8221; or &#8220;only one side involved, right or left origin not specified&#8221;.
