<div class='content chap10-para'>This new data item is needed to store the results of the derived algorithmic calculation of Derived SEER Combined T.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>The SEER Program has collected data from 2004 on AJCC 6th T, N, M and stage and from 2010 on AJCC 7th T, N, M and stage based on algorithmic derivation from Collaborative Stage (CS) data. These data were based on combining information from both the clinical and pathologic into a combined (or &#8216;best&#8217;) derived T, N, M and stage group. SEER would like to continue to be able to derive a combined T, N, M and stage group in order to evaluate time trends in cancer incidence by stage. SEER is designing an algorithm to combine the clinical and pathologic information for T, N, and M into a derived combined T, N and M and then the combined T, N, and M and additional information as needed are used to derive a combined stage.</div>
