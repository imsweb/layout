<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Records whether systemic hormonal agents were administered as first-course treatment at this facility or the reason they were not given. Hormone therapy consists of a group of drugs that may affect the long-term control of a cancer&#8217;s growth. It is not usually used as a curative measure.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Systemic therapy may involve the administration of one or a combination of agents. This data item allows for the evaluation of hormonal agents given as part of the first course of therapy. Furthermore, it is useful to know the reason hormone therapy was not administered when evaluating quality of care for certain tumors.
    <br/><br/>If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular facilities, the facility-level treatment fields must be used. The summary treatment fields, conversely, combine information for all reporting facilities that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing what part of the treatment was given at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.

    <em>Note</em>: Codes 02-03 entered under the<em> ROADS </em>rules for tumors diagnosed prior to January 1, 2003, should have been converted to the appropriate code in the new field RX SUMM--Transplnt/Endocr [3250] implemented with
    <em>FORDS</em>. Endocrine surgery and endocrine radiation therapy are no longer coded as Hormone Therapy for tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2003.
