<div class='content chap10-para'>Identifies systemic therapeutic procedures administered as part of the first course of treatment at this and all other facilities. If none of these procedures were administered then this item records the reason they were not performed. These include bone marrow transplants, stem cell harvests, surgical and/or radiation endocrine therapy.</div>

<div class='content chap10-para'>This data item allows the evaluation of patterns of treatment, which involve the alteration of the immune system or change the patient&#8217;s response to tumor cells but do not involve the administration of antineoplastic agents.</div>
