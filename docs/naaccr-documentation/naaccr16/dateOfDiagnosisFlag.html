<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This flag explains why no appropriate value in in the field, Date of Diagnosis [390]. This data item was first available in Volume II Version 12.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Before Version 12 (through 2009 diagnosis), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously been transmitted in date fields.</div>
