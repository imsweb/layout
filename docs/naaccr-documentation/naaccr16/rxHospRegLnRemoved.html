<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular facilities, the facility-level treatment fields must be used. The summary treatment fields, conversely, combine information for all reporting facilities that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing the extent of treatment given at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.</div>
