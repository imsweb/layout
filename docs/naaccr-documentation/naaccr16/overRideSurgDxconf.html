<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct.
    <br/><br/>This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
    <tab>RX Summ--Surg Prim Site, Diag Conf (SEER IF76)
        <tab><br/></tab>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See Chapter IV, Recommended Data Edits and Software Coordination of Standards.<br/><br/><strong>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</strong><br/>Edits of the type RX Summ--Surg Prim Site, Diag Conf check that cases with a primary site surgical procedure coded 20-90 are histologically confirmed.
    <tab>If the patient had a surgical procedure, most likely there was a microscopic examination of the cancer. Verify the surgery and diagnostic confirmation codes, and correct any errors. Sometimes there are valid reasons why no microscopic confirmation is achieved with the surgery; for example, the tissue removed may be inadequate for evaluation.<br/><br/><strong>Instructions for Coding</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for edits of the type, RX Summ--Surg Prim Site, Diag Conf.</li>
            <li>Leave blank and correct any errors for the case if an item is discovered to be incorrect.</li>
            <li>Code 1 if review confirms that they are correct. The patient had surgery, but the tissue removed was not sufficient for microscopic confirmation.</li>
