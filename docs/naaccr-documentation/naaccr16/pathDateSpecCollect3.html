        <div>This is a field to record when specimens are collected; can be used as approximate date of diagnosis in absence of other information. HL7 OBR-7 records the date and time (YYYYMMDDHHMMSS). NAACCR records the date (YYYYMMDD).</div>

        <p>This data item accommodates only one path report; if additional path reports were prepared, enter the date the specimen was collected in Path Date Spec Collect No 4 through Path Date Spec Collect No 5 [7323-7324]. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7012, 7092, 7102, 7192, and 7482.<br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Cancer registries collect cancer information from various sources including pathology laboratories. Pathology reports of different types may be sent via HL7 messages. Included here are data items coming from such a message to be included in the cancer registry database to aid in consolidating a cancer case when there is information from multiple sources. Traditionally, these data items were not part of the NAACCR Standards Volume II record layout and therefore provide a link to NAACCR Standards Volume V.
