<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Code for summary stage at the initial diagnosis or treatment of the reportable tumor. For hospital registries, CoC requires its use in the absence of a defined AJCC classification. For site-specific definitions of categories, see SEER
    <em>Summary Staging Manual 2000</em>.<br/><br/>Summary stage should include all information available through completion of surgery(ies) in the first course of treatment or within 4 months of diagnosis in the absence of disease progression, whichever is longer.
</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Stage information is important when evaluating the effects of cancer control programs. It is crucial in understanding whether changes over time in incidence rates or outcomes are due to earlier detection of the cancers. In addition, cancer treatment cannot be studied without knowing the stage at diagnosis.</div>

    <em>Note:</em> Code 8 has been added in Version 10.1 to be used when there is not an applicable code to reflect stage (e.g., benign brain, borderline ovarian).<em><br/><br/>Note:
</em>See also the item Derived SS2000 [3020] for the value of SEER Summary Stage 2000 as generated by the collaborative Staging algorithm.<br/><br/><strong>Clarification of NAACCR and NPCR Required Status</strong><br/>Summary stage is required. The correct data item to use (and corresponding code manual) is determined by the year in which the cancer was diagnosed. Tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2004, should be assigned a summary stage based upon the Collaborative Stage data item algorithms and retained in Derived SS2000 [3020]. Tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2001, should be assigned a summary stage according to the SEER
    <em>Summary Staging Manual 2000</em>, and the code should be reported in SEER Summary Stage 2000 [759]. Tumors diagnosed before January 1, 2001, should be assigned a summary stage according to
    <em>SEER Summary Stage Guide 1977</em>, and the code should be reported in SEER Summary Stage 1977 [760].
