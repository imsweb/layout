    <em>Note</em>: CoC discontinued collection of this item in 2003 when FORDS was implemented. For CoC, codes 7 and 8 were used for tumors diagnosed before 1996, but should have been converted to 0 in this field and to the appropriate code in the new field Reason for No Radiation [1430]. SEER continues to use codes 7 and 8 for all years. See Chapter V, Unresolved Issues, for further discussion.
    <br/><br/>In the SEER program, a code 2 for other radiation was used between 1973 and 1987. When the radiation codes were expanded to add codes &#8216;2&#8217; radioactive implants and &#8216;3&#8217; radioisotopes, all cases with a code &#8216;2&#8217; and diagnosed in 1973-1987 were converted to a code &#8216;6&#8217; radiation other than beam radiation.
