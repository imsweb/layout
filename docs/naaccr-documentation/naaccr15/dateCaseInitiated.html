<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Date the electronic abstract is initiated in the reporting facility's cancer registry database. See Chapter X for date format. Standard edits check that no dates are later than the current date or the date completed.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This item is used to assess and monitor the timeliness of reporting. Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) is a concern for all standard-setting organizations and consequently, timeliness standards have been established. Examples of use are as follows:<br/>
    <blockquote>
        <tab></tab>
        <p>This item can be used with the Date of 1<sup>st</sup>Contact&#160;[580] to measure timeliness of abstracting by individual reporting facilities</p>

        <p>This item can be used with Date Case Report Exported&#160;[2110] to determine the &#8220;residency time&#8221; of a case report within a reporting facility&#8217;s database prior to data transmission to a central cancer registry</p>

        <p>This item can be used with Date Case Report Received&#160;[2111] to monitor central registry timeliness in entering case reports (for case reports abstracted in-house from hardcopy provided by a reporting facility)</p>

        <p style=" page-break-after:avoid;">This item can be used with Date Case Completed&#160;[2090] to monitor timeliness of case report completion</p>
