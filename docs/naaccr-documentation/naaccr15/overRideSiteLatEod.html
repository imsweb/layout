    <p>Some computer edits identify errors. Others indicate possible errors that require manual review for resolution. To eliminate the need to review the same cases repeatedly, over-ride flags have been developed to indicate that data in a record (or records) have been reviewed and, while unusual, are correct. </p>

    <p>This over-ride is used with the following edits in the NAACCR Metafile of the EDITS software:
        <tab><br/></tab>
        &#160;&#160; &#160;&#160;
        <tab>Primary Site, Laterality, EOD, ICDO2 (SEER IF41) <br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>Some edits check for code combinations that are possible, but quite rare. If the code combination generates an error message and review of the case indicates that the codes are correct for the case, then the over-ride flag is used to skip the edit in the future. See Chapter IV, Recommended Data Edits and Software Coordination of Standards.<strong><br/><br/>Over-ride Flag as Used in the EDITS Software Package</strong><br/>Edits of this type Primary Site, Laterality, EOD apply to paired organs and do not allow EOD to be specified as
    <em>in situ</em>, localized, or regional by direct extension if laterality is coded as &#8220;bilateral, site unknown,&#8221; or &#8220;laterality unknown.&#8221;<strong><br/><br/>Instructions for Coding</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Leave blank if the program does not generate an error message for the edit Primary Site, Laterality, EOD, ICDO2 (SEER IF41) and/or Primary Site, Laterality, EOD, ICDO3 (SEER IF41).</li>
        <li>Code 1 if the case has been reviewed and it has been verified that the patient had laterality coded nonspecifically and EOD coded specifically.</li>
