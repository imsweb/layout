<div class='content chap10-para'>An identifying code (for example, a CLIA number) that uniquely identifies the pathology facility sending the first report of the case.<br/><br/>This data item accommodates information for only one path report. If additional path reports were prepared, enter the identifying code of pathology facility sending the report in Path Reporting Fac ID 2 through Path Reporting Fac ID 5 [7011-7014]. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7100, 7090, 7190, 7320, and 7480.

            <div>Cancer registries collect cancer information from various sources including pathology laboratories. Pathology reports of different types may be sent via HL7 messages. Included here are data items coming from such a message to be included in the cancer registry database to aid in consolidating a cancer case when there is information from multiple sources. Traditionally, these data items were not part of the NAACCR Standards Volume II record layout and therefore provide a link to NAACCR Standards Volume V.
