<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Description</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This item is used to describe the method of surgical approach used for patients undergoing surgery of the primary site at the reporting facility. If the patient has multiple surgeries to the primary site, this item describes the approach used for the most invasive, definitive surgery</div>
<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong><strong>Rationale</strong></strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>This item is used to monitor patterns and trends in the adoption and use of minimally-invasive surgical techniques.<br/><br/>If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular facilities, the facility-level treatment fields must be used. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing the extent of treatment given at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.
