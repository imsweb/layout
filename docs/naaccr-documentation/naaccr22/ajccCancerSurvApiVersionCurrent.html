<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>
    <div> This item indicates the most recently accessed version of the Cancer Surveillance .dll incorporated into the cancer registry software that created the record with stage data diagnosed 2018 and later. AJCC Cancer Surveillance DLL Version Current [2158] will be assigned based on the version of the AJCC Cancer Surveillance .dll in use in the registry software system. It must be updated every time a new version is incorporated into your system and all relevant cases should be updated to reflect the same value.</div>
    <ul>
        <li>For cases diagnosed prior to 2018, this field should remain blank.</li>
        <li>For cases diagnosed in 2018-2020, this field should be set to the AJCC Cancer Surveillance .dll version in use at the time of implementation.</li>
        <li>For cases diagnosed in 2018 and later abstracted after implementation, use the AJCC Cancer Surveillance .dll version in use at the time the case is being abstracted.</li>
    </ul>
    <div>The value is obtained from the .dll.</div>

<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>Over time, the definitions and other content contained in the .dll may change. This item identifies the current .dll content used to code the items.</div>
<div class='content chap10-para mark-changed'>This data item will be generated by registry software.<br/>
    <br/>The AJCC Cancer Surveillance API contains contents to support collection of AJCC's TNM, EOD, SSDIs, and directly entered Summary Stage 2018. The underlying contents are loaded from AJCC's API and SEER's web service. The API is versioned independently from the imported contents.<br/>
    <br/>The value indicates the version of the Cancer Surveillance API used most recently to code the items listed below and is obtained from the API. It should be recorded the first time the AJCC ID (including a value of XX) and/or Schema ID is determined and should be updated each time an updated AJCC Cancer Surveillance API is implemented.<br/>
