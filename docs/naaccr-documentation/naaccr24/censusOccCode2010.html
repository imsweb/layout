<strong>Alternate Names</strong>
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Census Occ Code 2010

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Code for the patient's usual occupation, using U.S. Census Bureau codes and NIOSH non-paid worker codes. This data item applies only to patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Usual occupation is defined as the type of job the patient was engaged in for most of his or her working life. Formerly Census Occ Code 2010.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>Use of a standard occupation classification system and associated codes improves the consistency of data collected from multiple sources and facilitates the use of data by researchers.</p>
<p><strong>Coding Instructions</strong></p>
<p>Occupation/industry coding should NOT be performed by reporting facilities. This is a central registry data item. Specially trained and qualified personnel should perform coding.</p>
<p>Codes for occupation are routinely updated to include new or more detailed codes. The 4-digit 2010 occupation codes from the U.S. Census Bureau and NIOSH are the most recent codes for occupation. When assigning occupation codes, central registries should use the most recent code set available. The occupation codes for 2010 may be used for earlier diagnosis years. Cases already coded with older occupation codes do not have to be recoded to the 2010 codes.</p>

<p>Note: The Division of Safety Research at CDC’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has developed new web-based software for automated coding of industry and occupation to appropriate year Census (1990, 2000, or 2010) classifications. This system also includes the NIOSH non-paid worker codes. The contact person for this software is Sue Nowlin, who can be contacted at <a href="mailto:sxn1@cdc.gov">sxn1@cdc.gov</a> or (513) 841-4467.<br />
