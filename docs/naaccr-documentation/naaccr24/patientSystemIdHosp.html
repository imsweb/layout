<br/><strong>NAACCR XML</strong>: Tumor.patientSystemIdHosp<br/><br/>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Description</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>The unique, non-repeating number automatically assigned to patients by the hospital tumor registry software system. The same number is used for all the patient's subsequent tumors. This Patient System ID-Hosp number should not be reused when a patient is deleted.</p>
<p>This number is different from Accession Number-Hosp [550]. While Accession Number-Hosp [550] is subject to change, the Patient System ID-Hosp number is created and maintained by the hospital tumor registry’s software system, and requires no key entry. Because the Patient System ID-Hosp number is unchanging, it affords an absolute linkage between a hospital patient record and a central registry’s patient record.</p>

</div>

<div class='content chap10-para-head'><strong>Rationale</strong></div>
<div class='content chap10-para'>
<p>This provides a stable identifier to link back to all reported tumors for a patient. It also serves as a reliable linking identifier; useful when central registries send follow-up information back to hospitals. Other identifiers such as social security number and medical record number, while useful, are subject to change and are thus less useful for this type of record linkage.</p>
