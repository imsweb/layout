<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Code for the county of the patient's residence at the time the tumor was diagnosed. For U.S. residents, standard codes are those of the FIPS publication "Counties and Equivalent Entities of the United States, Its Possessions, and Associated Areas." If the patient has multiple tumors, the county codes may be different for each tumor.

<br/><br/>Detailed standards have not been set for Canadian provinces/territories. Use code 998 for Canadian residents.&#160;

  <em>Note: </em>See Appendix A for standard FIPS county codes. See EDITS Table BPLACE.DBF in Appendix B for geocodes used by CoC.<em><br/><br/>Note:</em> SEER does not use code 998. CoC uses country geocodes for  nonresidents of the United States (see Appendix B) and 998 for residents  of other states.
