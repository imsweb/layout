<br/><b>Description</b><br/>

  <br/><br/>
  Formerly Date of Conclusive DX. 


<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This date will allow analysis of the primary site locations and frequency of cases that were originally diagnosed by ambiguous terminology and later confirmed by other conclusive method.

<br/><br/>This date will also allow for analysis of the time interval between cancer diagnosis based on ambiguous terminology and confirmation of the cancer diagnosis by conclusive means.
