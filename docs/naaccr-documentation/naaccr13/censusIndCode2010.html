<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Code for the patient's usual industry, using U.S. Census Bureau codes (see note below) according to coding procedures recommended for death certificates. This data item applies only to patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Usual industry refers to the type of activity at the patient's place of work for most of his or her working life. <br/><br/>
Note: Occupation/industry coding should NOT be performed by reporting facilities. This is a central cancer registry data item. Specially trained and qualified personnel should perform coding. <br/><br/>
Note: Census codes for industry are routinely updated to include new or more detailed codes. The 4-digit 2010 Census industry codes are the most recent codes for industry and are recommended for tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2013. The Census industry codes for 2010 may be used for earlier diagnosis years. Cases already coded with older codes do not have to be recoded to the 2010 codes. For more information, see the U.S. Census Bureau websites at: <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/ioindex.html">http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/ioindex.html</a> and <a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/documentation_main/">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/documentation_main/</a>.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Use of the Census Bureau classification system improves consistency of data collected from multiple sources. The Census Bureau industrial classification system is used for coding industry information from death certificates and from the U.S. Census of Population. The system includes specific coding rules.

  <em>Note:</em> The Division of Safety Research at CDC's National Institute  for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is developing new web-based  software for automated coding of industry and occupation to appropriate  year Census (1990, 2000, or 2010) classifications. The contact person  for this software is Sue Nowlin, who can be contacted at <a href="mailto:sxn1@cdc.gov">sxn1@cdc.gov</a> or (513) 841-4467.
