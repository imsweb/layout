<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Class of Case divides cases into two groups. Analytic cases (codes 00-22) are those that are required by CoC to be abstracted because of the program's primary responsibility in managing the cancer. Analytic cases are grouped according to the location of diagnosis and treatment. Treatment and outcome reports may be limited to analytic cases. Nonanalytic cases (codes 30-49 and 99) may be abstracted by the facility to meet central registry requirements or because of a request by the facility's cancer program. Nonanalytic cases are grouped according to the reason a patient who received care at the facility is nonanalytic, or the reason a patient who never received care at the facility may have been abstracted. 

<br/><br/>Class of Case can be used in conjunction with Type of Reporting Source [500]. Type of Reporting Source is designed to document the source of documents used to abstract the cancer being reported.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Class of Case reflects the facility's role in managing the cancer, whether the cancer is required to be reported by CoC, and whether the case was diagnosed after the program's Reference Date.

  <em>Note: </em>This expanded list of coded values is effective with  Version 12.   <br/><br/>*Indicates Class of Case codes appropriate for abstracting cases from  non-hospital sources such as physician offices, ambulatory surgery  centers, freestanding pathology laboratories, radiation therapy centers.  When applied to these types of facilities, the non-hospital source is  the reporting facility. The codes are applied the same way as if the  case were reported from a hospital.     <br/><br/>By using Class of Case codes in this manner for non-hospital sources,  the central cancer registry is able to retain information reflecting the  facility's role in managing the cancer consistent with the way it is  reported from hospitals. Using Class of Case in conjunction with Type of  Reporting Source [500] which identifies the source documents used to  abstract the cancer being reported, the central cancer registry has two  distinct types of information to use in making consolidation decisions
