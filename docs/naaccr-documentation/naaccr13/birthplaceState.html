<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
USPS abbreviation for the state, commonwealth, U.S. possession; or CanadaPost abbreviation for the Canadian province/territory in which the patient was born. If the patient has multiple primaries, the state of birth is the same for each tumor. This data item became part of the NAACCR transmission record effective with Volume II, Version 13 in order to include country and state for each geographic item and to use interoperable codes. It supplements the item BIRTHPLACE--COUNTRY [254].  These two data items are intended to replace the item BIRTHPLACE [250].

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This is a modification of the current item Birthplace [250] item in order to make use of standard codes, rather than using geographic codes that are only used by cancer registries. The intention is that item 250 be converted to populate the new corresponding, more standard, data items.
