<br/><b>Description</b><br/>

  The date on which the patient completes or receives the last radiation treatment at any facility. See Chapter X for date format. Use RX DATE RAD ENDED FLAG [3221] if there is no appropriate or known date for this item. 
  <br/><br/>
  Formerly RX Date--Radiation Ended. 


<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
The length of time over which radiation therapy is administered to a patient is a factor in tumor control and treatment morbidity. It is useful in evaluating the quality-of-care and the success of patient support programs designed to maintain continuity of treatment.
