<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Identifies care provided at the reporting facility in an effort to palliate or alleviate symptoms. Palliative procedures may include surgery, radiation therapy, systemic therapy (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, or other systemic drugs), and/or pain management.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This data item allows reporting facilities to track care that is considered palliative rather than diagnostic or curative in intent.  If central registries wish to study types of palliative care given at particular facilities, the facility-level fields must be used. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing what palliative procedures and care was performed at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.
