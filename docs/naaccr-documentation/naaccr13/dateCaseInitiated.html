<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Date the electronic abstract is initiated in the reporting facility's cancer registry database. See Chapter X for date format. Standard edits check that no dates are later than the current date or the date completed.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This item is used to assess and monitor the timeliness of reporting. Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) is a concern for all standard-setting organizations and consequently, timeliness standards have been established. Examples of use are as follows:
<br/><ul>
<li>This item can be used with the Date of 1Contact[580] to measure timeliness of abstracting by individual reporting facilities</li>
<li>This item can be used with Date Case Report Exported[2110] to determine the "residency time" of a case report within a reporting facility's database prior to data transmission to a central cancer registry</li>
<li>This item can be used with Date Case Report Received[2111] to monitor central registry timeliness in entering case reports (for case reports abstracted in-house from hardcopy provided by a reporting facility)</li>
<li>This item can be used with Date Case Completed[2090] to monitor timeliness of case report completion</li>
</ul>
