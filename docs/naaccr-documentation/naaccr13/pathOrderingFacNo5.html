<br/><br/>This item accommodates only one path report. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7014, 7094, 7104, and 7484.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Describes the origin of the fifth pathology report contributing to this cancer abstract. The facility where the specimen described in the fifth path report was obtained is most likely the location of the medical record for the patient as well as any residual tissue.
