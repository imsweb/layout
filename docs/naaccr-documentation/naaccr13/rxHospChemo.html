<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Records the type of chemotherapy administered at the reporting facility as a part of first course therapy or the reason chemotherapy was not given.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Systemic therapy may involve the administration of one or a combination of agents. This data item allows for the evaluation of chemotherapeutic agents given as part of the first course of therapy. Furthermore, it is useful to know the reason chemotherapy was not administered when evaluating quality of care. 

<br/><br/>If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular facilities, the facility-level treatment fields must be used. The summary treatment fields, conversely, combine information for all facilities that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing what part of the treatment was given at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.
