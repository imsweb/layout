<br/><b>Description</b><br/>

  Records the date the patient was discharged following primary site surgery. The date corresponds to the event recorded in RX Date Mst Defn Srg [3170]. See Chapter X for date format. Use RX DATE SURG DISCH FLAG [3181] if there is no appropriate or known date for this item. 
  <br/><br/>
  Formerly RX Date--Surgical Disch. 


<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Length of stay is an important quality-of-care and financial measure among hospital administrations, those who fund public and private health care, and public health users. This date, in conjunction with the data item RX Date Mst Defn Srg [3170], will allow for the calculation of a patient's length of hospitalization associated with primary site surgery.
