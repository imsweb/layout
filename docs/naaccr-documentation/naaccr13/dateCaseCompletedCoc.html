<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Identifies the date that specified items are completed, based on the Class of Case, where those items pass the relevant edits. Follow-up information, including delayed treatment received elsewhere, may be coded after the Date Case Completed--CoC. See the current <em>FORDS</em> for details. This item should be autocoded by the registry software; specifications may be obtained from NCDB. The CoC specifications will not necessarily be the same as those used for Date Case Completed [2090]. See Chapter X for date format.
