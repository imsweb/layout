<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Describes the removal, biopsy, or aspiration of regional lymph node(s) performed at the reporting facility for diagnosis and/or staging or as a part of the first course of therapy.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This item is important for evaluating quality of care and treatment practices relating to initial diagnosis, staging and/or first course of therapy.  If central registries wish to study the treatment given at particular  facilities, the facility-level treatment fields must be used. The summary treatment fields, conversely, combine information for all hospitals that provide first course of treatment for the tumor. Facility-specific fields allow studies of detailed referral patterns and treatment by type of healthcare setting. Knowing the extent of treatment given at a particular facility also helps resolve consolidation issues.

  <br/><br/><b>Codes (Refer to the most recent version  of <em>FORDS</em> for instructions that should be applied to all surgically treated cases for all types of cancers.) </b><br/>
The treatment of breast and skin cancers are where the distinction between sentinel lymph node biopsies (SLNBx) and more extensive dissection of regional lymph nodes is most frequently encountered. For all other sites, non-sentinel regional node dissections are typical, and codes 2, 6 and 7 are infrequently used.<br/>

  <em>Note:</em> One important use of registry data is the tracking of  treatment patterns over time. To compare contemporary treatment to previously published treatment based  on former codes, or to data unmodified from pre-1998 definitions, the  ability to differentiate surgeries in which four or more regional lymph  nodes are removed is desirable. However, it is very important to note  that the distinction between codes 4 and 5 is made to permit comparison  of current surgical procedures with procedures coded in the past when  the removal of fewer than 4 nodes was not reflected in surgery codes. It  is not intended to reflect clinical significance when applied to a  particular surgical procedure. It is important to avoid inferring, by  data presentation or other methods, that one category is preferable to  another within the intent of these items.
