<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Identifies all cases, including death certificate only and autopsy only, for which an ambiguous term is the most definitive word or phrase used to establish a cancer diagnosis (i.e., to determine whether or not the case is reportable). Ambiguous terminology may originate from any source document, such as pathology report, radiology report, or from a clinical report. This data item is used only when ambiguous terminology is used to establish diagnosis. It is not used when ambiguous terminology is used to clarify a primary site, specific histology, histologic group, or stage of disease.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Cases with a reportable cancer diagnosis that has been established based only on reports that contain ambiguous terminology to describe final diagnostic findings cannot currently be identified. Multiple surveys have identified a lack of consensus in the interpretation and use of ambiguous terms across physician specialties. These cases may or may not have an actual cancer diagnosis based on clinician, radiologist, and pathologist review. Furthermore, the historical interpretation and use of ambiguous terms by cancer registrars and registries has not been consistent or compatible with physician use of these terms. 

<br/><br/>This data item will identify specific primary sites where the ambiguous terminology is commonly used to describe or establish a cancer diagnosis. Data collected will be used as the basis for modifications to case inclusion and reportable rules following complete analysis and impact assessment. This data item will allow cases to be identified within an analysis file and be excluded from patient contact studies.
