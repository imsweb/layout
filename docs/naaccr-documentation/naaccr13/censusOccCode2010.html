<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Code for the patient's usual occupation, using U.S. Census Bureau codes (see note below) according to coding procedures recommended for death certificates. This data item applies only to patients who are age 14 years or older at the time of diagnosis. Usual occupation is defined as type of job the patient was engaged in for most of his or her working life. <br/><br/>
Note: Occupation/industry coding should NOT be performed by reporting facilities. This is a central registry data item. Specially trained and qualified personnel should perform coding. <br/><br/>
Note: Census codes for occupation are routinely updated to include new or more detailed codes. The 4-digit 2010 Census codes for occupation are the most recent codes for occupation and are recommended for tumors diagnosed on or after January 1, 2013. The Census occupation codes for 2010 may be used for earlier diagnosis years. Cases already coded with older codes do not have to be recoded to the 2010 codes. For more information, see the U.S. Bureau of the Census website at: <a href="http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/ioindex.html">http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/ioindex/ioindex.html</a> and <br/><a href="http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/documentation_main/">http://www.census.gov/acs/www/data_documentation/documentation_main/</a>.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Use of the Census Bureau classification system improves consistency of data collected from multiple sources. The Census Bureau occupation classification system is used for coding occupation information from death certificates and from the U.S. Census of Population. The system includes specific coding rules.

  Codes<br/>The Division of Safety Research at CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) is developing new web-based software for automated coding of industry and occupation to appropriate year Census (1990, 2000, or 2010) classifications.
