<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This flag explains why no appropriate value is in the field, Date of Last Contact [1750]. This data item first available in Volume II Version 12.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Before Version 12 (through 2009 diagnosis), date fields included codes that provided information other than dates. As part of an initiative to standardize date fields, new fields were introduced to accommodate non-date information that had previously been transmitted in date fields.

<br/><br/><b>
  Codes (See Appendix H for the complete Flavors of Null table, which includes the NAACCR codes, HL7 codes and definitions.)

        <td class="naaccr-codes-cell">A proper value is applicable but not known. This event occurred, but the date is unknown (e.g., date of last contact is unknown).</td>

        <td class="naaccr-codes-cell">A valid date value is provided in item Date of Last Contact [1750], or the date was not expected to have been transmitted.</td>

<br/>Comment: This is part of the initiative of the transformation from the old NAACCR date standards to interoperable dates.
