<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Facility ID number of the facility where the specimen described in the fourth path report was removed/collected. 

<br/><br/>Use the National Provider Identifier (NPI) if possible. Otherwise, use a number defined by the American Hospital Association (AHA), or some other standard-setting organization such as the American College of Surgeons (ACoS) or Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA).

<br/><br/>This item accommodates only one path report; if an additional path report was prepared, enter the facility ID number in Path Ordering Fac No 5 [7194]. Information in this data item should refer to the path report described in data items 7013, 7093, 7103, and 7483.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Describes the origin of the fourth pathology report contributing to this cancer abstract. The facility where the specimen was obtained is most likely the location of the medical record for the patient as well as any residual tissue.
