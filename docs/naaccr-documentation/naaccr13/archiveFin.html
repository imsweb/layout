<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
This field identifies the CoC Facility Identification Number (FIN) of the facility at the time it originally accessioned the tumor.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
When CoC accredited facilities merge or join networks, their unique CoC Facility Identification Number (FIN) [540] may change. Archive FIN preserves the identity of the facility at the time the case was originally accessioned so that records resubmitted subsequent to such a reorganization can be recognized as belonging to the same facility

<b><br/><br/>Instructions for Coding</b><br/>CoC maintains the codes, including those for non-hospital sources of reporting.

<br/><br/>For facilities with 7-digit FINs in the range of 6020009-6953290 that were assigned by CoC before January 1, 2001, the coded FIN will consist of three leading zeroes followed by the full 7-digit number.

<br/><br/>For facilities with FINs greater than or equal to 10000000 that were assigned by CoC after January 1, 2001, enter FIN codes of this type as two zeroes followed by the full 8-digit code. These sometimes are called CoC FIN 10-digit codes.
