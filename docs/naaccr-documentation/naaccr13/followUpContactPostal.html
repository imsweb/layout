<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Postal code for the address of the follow-up contact's current usual residence. If the patient has multiple tumors, the Follow-up Contact-Postal should be the same for all tumors. For U.S. residents, use either the 5-digit or the extended 9-digit ZIP code. Blanks follow the 5-digit code. For Canadian residents, use the 6-character, alphanumeric postal code. Blanks follow the 6-character code. When available, enter postal code for other countries.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Sometimes registries carry out follow-up by contacting the patient and other contacts by a letter or phone call to ascertain their vital status. When a patient's current address is unknown or the patient is for some reason not to be contacted (e.g., patient is a minor child), the most current name, address and phone number of another contact, such as a relative or neighbor are needed. This information may also be useful for conducting research studies.
