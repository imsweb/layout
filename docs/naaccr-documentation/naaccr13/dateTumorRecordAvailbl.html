<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Date the demographic and tumor identification information on a primary/reportable neoplasm, compiled from one or more source records, from one or more facilities, is available in the central cancer registry database to be counted as an incident tumor. Cancer identification information includes, at a minimum, site, histology, laterality, behavior, and date of diagnosis. See Chapter X for date format.

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
This item is used to assess and monitor the timeliness of reporting. Timeliness of abstracting (and reporting) is a concern for all standard-setting organizations. This data item can be used with the Date Case Report Received [2111] to measure timeliness of processing within the central cancer registry. This item also can be used with the Date of 1st Contact [580] or the Path--Date of Specimen Collection [7320] to measure overall timeliness.
