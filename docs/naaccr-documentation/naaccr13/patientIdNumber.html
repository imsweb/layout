<br/><b>Description</b><br/>
Unique number assigned to an individual patient by the central registry. The central registry will assign this same number to all of the patient's subsequent tumors (records). 

<br/><br/>Patient ID Number will only differ when multiple central registries accession the same patient. Each central registry will assign their unique Patient ID Number.

<br/><br/>NAACCR recommends that the registry should not reissue or reuse this number when a patient's record is deleted from the files.

<br/><br/>In the transmit file (data exchange) this number will be the Patient ID Number assigned by the sending registry as defined in Registry ID [40].

<br/><br/><b>Rationale</b><br/>
Provides the central registry with a unique identification number that will link all records (multiple tumors) for the same patient. The unique number also allows the central registry to identify the patient when there are multiple reports from different hospitals.
